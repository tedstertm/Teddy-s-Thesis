\section{Introduction}
Microfluidic systems are fundamentally transforming medicine, diagnostics, and analytical systems, at an academic and industry level. In particular, microfluidics enables a more efficient use of rare samples and reagents \cite{Burns1998, Ingham2007, Song2006a, Thorsen2002a}, observations and measurements at single molecule or cell levels \cite{Kopp1998, Hong2012}, and engineering platforms of higher relevance to the system being studied \cite{Berthier2013,Huh2010a,Jeon2015,Meyvantsson2008,Sackmann2014a,Domenech2009}. Despite enabling features, microfluidics come with significant challenges that pose barriers to adoption. Manufacturing enclosed channels at a sub-millimetric scale is a ubiquitous step in traditional microfluidic platforms that increases cost and complexity of fabrication \cite{Guckenberger2015b,Sackmann2014}. At the industry level, this step often involves highly-guarded trade secrets that slow innovation and development of microfluidic-based products. Usability, reliability, and accessibility are also renown difficulties that limit the field of use and audience for microdevices \cite{Casavant2013, Sackmann2014}. Here, we present advances in open microfluidics, a novel approach to designing microfluidic systems that allows the precision of traditional closed microfluidic systems while fundamentally improving affordability, simplicity, and reliability.

The development of simple methods that lower the barriers of adoption for microfluidic systems has increasingly been a focus of research \cite{Berthier2013,Casavant2013b, Du2009, Guckenberger2015, Walker2002, Young2011}. Seminal innovations in microfluidic technologies have proven that a reduction in the complexity of use or fabrication result in an exponential growth in the adoption of these systems \cite{Berthier2012,Sackmann2014a}. The initial widely recognized development in microfabrication that unlocked the field for widespread adoption is soft lithography and the use of silicone polymers for device fabrication \cite{Sia2003a}. Other developments of importance to medicine and diagnostics that expanded the breadth of applications was the use of thermoplastics through micromilling \cite{Guckenberger2015b, Wilson2011}, hot-embossing \cite{Young2011}, or laser cutting \cite{Klank2002, Yuen2009MultidimensionalSystem}. The emergence of high-resolution stereolithography additive printing (SLA, commonly referred to as 3D-printing) is promising to rapidly transform the field of microfluidics. In particular, 3D-printing facilitates the design-to-manufacturing transition and microfluidic assembly, as it enables the production of ready-to-use channels that do not require bonding or other forms of preparation \cite{Au2014, Bhargava2014}. However, SLA imposes important material limitations (e.g. limited biocompatibility) and uncured resin must be removed from the channels after manufacturing thereby limiting the complexity of the geometries achievable. Simplification of microfluidics technologies has also been demonstrated by using paper fibers as both a path for fluid and a pumping method, showing great promise to develop ultra-low cost diagnostic and detection systems \cite{Martinez2008, Osborn2010a, Park2013a}. Paper-based devices are incredibly cost-effective to produce, user-friendly and intuitive to operate, and reliable to use since they don’t rely on pressure sources, seals, and cannot fail due to air bubbles. However fluid handling in paper is limited, in particular the ability to exchange and wash fluids, and material interaction and adsorption challenges are increased due to the high surface-to-volume ratios. The common theme of microfluidic development is the reduction of manufacturing and user-operation cost and complexity. There remains, however, a trade-off between control over the fluid and operational simplicity.

Open microfluidics describes the flow of fluids in channels that have one or more open faces; the simplest being a rectangular channel with no ceiling \cite{Berthier2012, Casavant2013}. Open microfluidics allows the control over fluids on-par with traditional closed-fluidics while providing manufacturing simplicity and reliability of use on par with paper-microfluidics. In open microfluidics, fluid flow is driven directed by capillary force provided by the solid parts of the cross section of the channel allowing the fluid to span over the open sections of the cross section. We compile here the initial forays of open microfluidics and expand on them to demonstrate the potential of open microfluidics to further democratize the prototyping and manufacturing of microfluidic-based systems that are reliable and low-cost. We show that open microfluidics is a ubiquitous technology that enables control over fluid handling, access to the sample throughout the device operation, simple manufacturing and prototyping (compatible with injection molding and 3D printing), and the potential to create non-planar reconfigurable systems. We present a suite of devices that are driven by open microfluidics and designed to overcome many limitations that current microfluidic platforms have to adoption research communities at large. Finally, we show that reconfigurable systems can be created utilizing the example of Lego-like blocks that enable the creation of a bread-board microfluidic system that can be modified during the operation of the device.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Open microfluidic conditions for flow}
Open microfluidics is a class of microfluidic channels that are defined as having one or more open-air interfaces along the path of the channels (Figure 1A). Early work has developed an analytical model that allows the design of open microfluidic systems in which capillary flow occurs, termed spontaneous capillary flow (SCF, (B.P. Casavant et al., 2013)). Subsequent analytical and numerical simulation-based work have demonstrated an improved equation to predict the flow in open systems based on any number of surfaces each with a distinct surface energy (resulting in an apparent contact angle for the whole system, known as the generalized Cassie’s law [ref], Figure 1B). Experimentally, open microfluidic systems have demonstrated the potential to create enabling systems for analytical chemistry (liquid-liquid extractions, (Barkal et al., 2016)) and cell biology (cell migration) that are highly accessible and manufacturable. For increased connectivity flows can be designed with no ceiling or floor in which the fluid is simply pinned from both edges (Figure 1A). These types of flows allow the addition of dual stimuli to the channel. For increased capillary force, as detailed in the flow conditions presented in figure 1, flows can be designed using parallel beams or fibers (Figure 1A).

The conditions for flow to occur in bulk (i.e. not as individual Concus-Finn filaments in wedges) in an open microfluidic channel have been demonstrated [ref suspended] and are summarized in figure 1B. For a material with a contact angle , a length of   along the cross-sectional perimeter representing the liquid-solid interfaces, and a length of  along the cross-sectional perimeter representing the liquid-air interfaces, the conditions for flow are described by equation 1. When this condition is met fluid flow occurs by capillary action in the microfluidic network and functional systems can be developed. Else capillary flow as a bulk in the channel does not occur. 

\begin{equation}
    cos\ \theta> \frac{P_f}{P_w}
\end{equation}

The conditions for flow has been generalized for an open channel that is composed of any number of materials with different contact angles through a generalized Cassie equation (Figure 1C) [Ref Berthier Brakke]. In this case an equivalent contact angle, , can be calculated as a weighed sum of the contact angles of each surface (equation 2). The equivalent contact angle  can be used in the standard capillary flow conditions to predict if flow will occur, i.e. if  capillary flow will occur, else flow may in the channels may not occur. The generalized Cassie equation is particularly useful when calculating conditions for flow in parallel beams or fibers that may have different properties, or flows between plates of different hydrophilicities.

\begin{equation}
    \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
cos \theta^{*} =  \sum cos\theta_{i} \ f_{i}\\
\theta^{*} \ < \ 90^{o}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Open microfluidic enables flow in 3 dimensional systems}
Microfluidic fabrication is a notoriously complex process that has been the subject of intense research. Traditionally microfluidic systems have been designed on planar surfaces such as glass, silicon, or plastic sheets to allow reliable bonding of a cover for the channels [Refs silicon and glass devices]. Open microfluidics inherently alleviates the requirement for complex bonding procedures and the channels can be used immediately after fabrication without the need for subsequent bonding steps. The open nature of the channels also allows for robust and homogeneous treatment of the surfaces, such as plasma treatment, chemical vapor deposition, or spray coating \cite{Casavant2013, Hong2012}

Microfluidics suffers from important reliability and usability barriers. The potential for critical failure of microfluidic channels due to the creation of an air-bubble is a significant limitation towards the use of microsystems in commercial applications. In particular, for systems containing junctures of 2 fluid flows, timing of each flow is critical to prevent air bubble formation. Using open systems, merging any number of flows is robust and independent of synchronization of each flow. Asynchronous fluid flows can be input into the system and air bubbles cannot be created as air can escape from any location along the channel length (Figure 2C). 

As no bonding procedure is required, open channels can be created on non-planar and 3-dimensional surfaces in which the fluid starts from a location and can follow a channel imprinted along multiple intersecting planes (Figure 2A,B). When working in 3D geometries gravity can play an important role and create channel failures. Decreasing the SCF condition increases the capillary strength of the open channels and allows fluids to travel robustly in 3-dimensional systems. A precise estimation of the maximum height a fluid can travel in open microfluidic channels can be obtained using the generalized contact angle (equation 2) in the standard height of fluid equation.

\begin{equation}
    \Delta h = \frac{\sum f_{i}\gamma cos \theta}{\rho g a }
\end{equation}

Open microfluidic channels are in particular ideally suited for 3D printing as channels can be designed in any surface of the part, including hidden or upside down surfaces or complex curved surfaces (Figure 2B). As every location in the channel is accessible, uncured resin can easily be removed from the channel by rinsing or sonication. This aspect has been utilized to demonstrate the potential geometries and channel configurations presented throughout this document.

\subsection{Reconfigurable open microfluidic systems during the operation of the device}

The prototyping power for reconfigurable microfluidic channels has been demonstrated using 3D printed closed microfluidic systems \cite{Au2014}. Open microfluidics, through the use of capillary forces do not have the same requirements for sealing and resisting pressure sources. The ability to function in the open also allows the access of the fluids during the operation of the channel and the creation of systems that are reconfigurable during the operation of the devices (Jason, Stacks). Leveraging these advantages, we have developed a modular, reconfigurable open microfluidic prototyping platform.

The prototyping platform consists of individual blocks with open channels that can be placed on any face of the block and designed for a function such as mixing or can have valves built in (Fig. 3A). Fluidic components of individual blocks interface with each other with a connector that prevents flow while blocks are separated (Fig. 3B). The connection consists of a vertical semi-circular open channel that terminates near the bottom of a block. When filled the pressure is low enough such that the fluid at the end of the channel pins and is held by surface tension. The receptor on the next block in the interface is a tapered pin connected to the open fluidics on its channel. When interfaced, the pin on the lower block breaks the surface tension of the droplet on the upper block and allows flow between blocks. The blocks themselves can be built into open microfluidic circuits with a peg attachment system and can be interfaced with Lego® blocks for use as scaffolding (Fig. 3C). The interface at both the fluidic and block level is designed so that individual blocks such as sources and receptacles are easily interchangeable and replaceable and will not result in spilling of fluid allowing for prototyping multi-step or time-based circuits.
