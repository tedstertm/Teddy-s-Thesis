As stated in the introduction, at the heart of engineering is balance. My efforts to develop a real-time conditioned media device was a great lesson in this fact. In my previous work, a premium was placed on leveraging physical principles to replace automation with passive components to simplify device design and bring advanced microfluidic functionality to a small and simple package. However, in this case, it is likely that the use of automation \emph{is}, in fact, simpler. Struggles to keep subtle physical forces in balance are replaced by the clicks of a button. The trick is to find where simplicity meets both modularity and robustness.
