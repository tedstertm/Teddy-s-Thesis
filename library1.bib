@article{Lin2007,
	Abstract = {It has been established that cancer can be promoted and/or exacerbated by inflammation and infections. Indeed, chronic inflammation orchestrates a tumor-supporting microenvironment that is an indispensable participant in the neoplastic process. The mechanisms that link infection, innate immunity, inflammation, and cancer are being unraveled at a fast pace. Important components in this linkage are the cytokines produced by activated innate immune cells that stimulate tumor growth and progression. In addition, soluble mediators produced by cancer cells recruit and activate inflammatory cells, which further stimulate tumor progression. However, inflammatory cells also produce cytokines that can limit tumor growth. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of the role of inflammation-induced cytokines in tumor initiation, promotion, and progression.},

	Abstract = {Bone marrow (BM) angiogenesis is increased in multiple myeloma and is an important prognostic factor for survival. Previous studies have shown that BM angiogenesis does not change following chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Given its potential antiangiogenic effect, we evaluated if thalidomide therapy would affect the BM microvessel density (MVD). We studied BM angiogenesis in 81 patients with various disease stages treated with thalidomide with or without dexamethasone. MVD was determined as previously described. MVD was compared between pretreatment marrows and those obtained 4-6 months following therapy. The median (range) MVD pretherapy was 28 (2-116) and post-therapy was 15 (3-97). A partial or complete response was seen in 58{\%} of patients, stable disease in 41{\%} and progressive disease in one patient. MVD decreased significantly in responders (median decrease of 12, P{\textless}0.001). In contrast, no significant change in MVD was seen in those failing to respond to thalidomide. Unlike the lack of resolution of angiogenesis reported with other therapies, we demonstrate for the first time a significant decrease in microvessels with thalidomide therapy. Although not conclusive, this result lends further support to the hypothesis that angiogenesis is a relevant therapeutic target in myeloma.},

@article{Folkman1973,
	Abstract = {Multi-cell spheroids were grown in soft agar. When each spheroid was cultured in a large volume of medium, frequently renewed, all spheroids eventually reached a dormant phase at a diameter of approximately 3-4 mm and a population of approximately 106 cells. In the dormant spheroid, newly generated cells at the periphery balanced those lost by necrosis in the center. We propose that this dormant phase is due to a gradual reduction in the ratio of surface area to volume: a size is achieved beyond which there is insufficient surface area for the spheroid to eliminate catabolites and absorb nutrients. Thus, in the face of unlimited space and of new medium, three-dimensional cell populations become self-regulating. This phenomenon contrasts with standard tissue culture in which cell populations, living on a flat plane in two dimensions, will not stop growing in the face of unlimited space and new medium because the ratio of surface area to volume remains constant.These experiments provide a mechanism for our observations in vivo: before vascularization, solid tumors live by simple diffusion as three-dimensional spheroids or ellipsoids. They become dormant at a diameter of only a few millimeters; once vascularized, they are released from this dormant phase and begin exponential growth. Thus, tumor dormancy resulting from absence of angiogenesis in vivo, may operate by the same mechanism responsible for dormancy of spheroids in vitro.},

	Abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by significant genetic diversity at subclonal levels that have a defining role in the heterogeneity of tumor progression, clinical aggressiveness and drug sensitivity. Although genome profiling studies have demonstrated heterogeneity in subclonal architecture that may ultimately lead to relapse, a gene expression-based prediction program that can identify, distinguish and quantify drug response in sub-populations within a bulk population of myeloma cells is lacking. In this study, we performed targeted transcriptome analysis on 528 pre-treatment single cells from 11 myeloma cell lines and 418 single cells from 8 drug-na{\"{i}}ve MM patients, followed by intensive bioinformatics and statistical analysis for prediction of proteasome inhibitor sensitivity in individual cells. Using our previously reported drug response gene expression profile signature at the single-cell level, we developed an R Statistical analysis package available at https://github.com/bvnlabSCATTome, SCATTome (single-cell analysis of targeted transcriptome), that restructures the data obtained from Fluidigm single-cell quantitative real-time-PCR analysis run, filters missing data, performs scaling of filtered data, builds classification models and predicts drug response of individual cells based on targeted transcriptome using an assortment of machine learning methods. Application of SCATT should contribute to clinically relevant analysis of intratumor heterogeneity, and better inform drug choices based on subclonal cellular responses.},

@article{Mitsiades2002,
	Abstract = {The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) confers significant survival potential in a variety of tumors. Several established or novel anti-multiple myeloma (anti-MM) agents, such as dexamethasone, thalidomide, and proteasome inhibitors (PS-341), inhibit NF-kappaB activity as part of their diverse actions. However, studies to date have not delineated the effects of specific inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in MM. We therefore investigated the effect of SN50, a cell-permeable specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and activity, on MM cells. SN50 induced apoptosis in MM cell lines and patient cells; down-regulated expression of Bcl-2, A1, X-chromosome-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP-1), cIAP-2, and survivin; up-regulated Bax; increased mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm; and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not caspase-8. We have previously demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is present locally in the bone marrow microenvironment and induces NF-kappaB-dependent up-regulation of adhesion molecules on both MM cells and bone marrow stromal cells, with resultant increased adhesion. In this study, TNF-alpha alone induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 up-regulation, and MM cell proliferation; in contrast, SN50 pretreatment sensitized MM cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3, similar to our previous finding of SN50-induced sensitization to apoptosis induced by the TNF-alpha family member TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/Apo2L. Moreover, SN50 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced expression of another NF-kappaB target gene, intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Although the p38 inhibitor PD169316 did not directly kill MM cells, it potentiated the apoptotic effect of SN50, suggesting an interaction between the p38 and NF-kappaB pathways. Our results therefore demonstrate that NF-kappaB activity in MM cells promotes tumor-cell survival and protects against apoptotic stimuli. These studies provide the framework for targeting NF-kappaB activity in novel biologically based therapies for MM.},

@article{Au2014,
	Abstract = {The vast majority of microfluidic devices are developed in PDMS by molding ("soft lithography") because PDMS is an inexpensive material, has physicochemical properties that are well suited for biomedical and physical sciences applications, and design cycle lengths are generally adequate for prototype development. However, PDMS molding is tediously slow and thus cannot provide the high- or medium-volume production required for the commercialization of devices. While high-throughput plastic molding techniques (e.g. injection molding) exist, the exorbitant cost of the molds and/or the equipment can be a serious obstacle for device commercialization, especially for small startups. High-volume production is not required to reach niche markets such as clinical trials, biomedical research supplies, customized research equipment, and classroom projects. Crucially, both PDMS and plastic molding are layer-by-layer techniques where each layer is produced as a result of physicochemical processes not specified in the initial photomask(s) and where the final device requires assembly by bonding, all resulting in a cost that is very hard to predict at the start of the project. By contrast, stereolithography (SL) is an automated fabrication technique that allows for the production of quasi-arbitrary 3D shapes in a single polymeric material at medium-volume throughputs (ranging from a single part to hundreds of parts). Importantly, SL devices can be designed between several groups using CAD tools, conveniently ordered by mail, and their cost precisely predicted via a web interface. Here we evaluate the resolution of an SL mail-order service and the main causes of resolution loss; the optical clarity of the devices and how to address the lack of clarity for imaging in the channels; and the future role that SL could play in the commercialization of microfluidic devices.},

@article{Matsui2008,
	Abstract = {Many agents are active in multiple myeloma, but the majority of patients relapse. This clinical pattern suggests most cancer cells are eliminated, but cells with the clonogenic potential to mediate tumor regrowth are relatively chemoresistant. Our previous data suggested that CD138(+) multiple myeloma plasma cells cannot undergo long-term proliferation but rather arise from clonogenic CD138(neg) B cells. We compared the relative sensitivity of these distinct cell types to clinical antimyeloma agents and found that dexamethasone, lenadilomide, bortezomib, and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide inhibited CD138(+) multiple myeloma plasma cells but had little effect on CD138(neg) precursors in vitro. We further characterized clonogenic multiple myeloma cells and stained cell lines using the Hoechst side population and Aldefluor assays. Each assay identified CD138(neg) cells suggesting that they possess high drug efflux capacity and intracellular drug detoxification activity. We also found that multiple myeloma cells expressing the memory B-cell markers CD20 and CD27 could give rise to clonogenic multiple myeloma growth in vitro and engraft immunodeficient nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficient mice during both primary and secondary transplantation. Furthermore, both the side population and Aldefluor assays were capable of identifying circulating clonotypic memory B-cell populations within the peripheral blood of multiple myeloma patients. Our results suggest that circulating clonotypic B-cell populations represent multiple myeloma stem cells, and the relative drug resistance of these cells is mediated by processes that protect normal stem cells from toxic injury.},

	Abstract = {In conventional hanging drop (HD) methods, embryonic stem cell aggregates or embryoid bodies (EBs) are often maintained in small inverted droplets. Gravity limits the volumes of these droplets to less than 50 $\mu$L, and hence such cell cultures can only be sustained for a few days without frequent media changes. Here we present a new approach to performing long-term HD methods (10--15 days) that can provide larger media reservoirs in a HD format to maintain more consistent culture media conditions. To implement this approach, we fabricated hollow sphere (HS) structures by injecting liquid drops into noncured poly(dimethylsiloxane) mixtures. These structures served as cell culture chambers with large media volumes (500 $\mu$L in each sphere) where EBs could grow without media depletion. The results showed that the sizes of the EBs cultured in the HS structures in a long-term HD format were approximately twice those of conventional HD methods after 10 days in culture. Further, HS cultures showed multilineage differ...},

@article{Reagan2012,
	Abstract = {Hematologic malignancies rely heavily on support from host cells through a number of well-documented mechanisms. Host cells, specifically mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), support tumor cell growth, metastasis, survival, bone marrow colonization, and evasion of the immune system. In multiple myeloma, similar to solid tumors, supporting cells have typically been considered healthy host cells. However, recent evidence reveals that many MSCs derived from patients with multiple myeloma (MM-MSC) show significant defects compared with MSCs from nondiseased donors (ND-MSC). These abnormalities range from differences in gene and protein expression to allelic abnormalities and can initiate after less than 1 day of coculture with myeloma cells or persist for months, perhaps years, after removal from myeloma influence. Alterations in MM-MSC function contribute to disease progression and provide new therapeutic targets. However, before the scientific community can capitalize on the distinctions between MM-MSCs and ND-MSCs, a number of confusions must be clarified, as we have done in this review, including the origin(s) of MM-MSCs, identification and characterization of MM-MSCs, and downstream effects and feedback circuits that support cancer progression. Further advances require more genetic analysis of MM-MSCs and disease models that accurately represent MSC-MM cell interactions.},

This work describes the electrical surface properties of SEBS block copolymers using current monitoring experiments to determine zeta potential. We show that SEBS exhibits a stable and relatively high zeta potential magnitude compared to similar polymers. The zeta potential of SEBS is stable when stored in air over time, and no significant differences are observed between different batches and devices, demonstrating reproducibility of results. We show zeta potential trends for varying pH and counterion concentration and demonstrate that SEBS has a repeatable surface potential comparable to glass. Oxygen plasma treatment greatly increases the zeta potential magnitude immediately following treatment before undergoing a moderate hydrophobic recovery to a stable zeta potential. SEBS copolymers also offer simple rapid prototyping fabrication and mass production potential. The presented electrokinetic properties combined with simple, low-cost fabrication of microdevices make SEBS a quality material for electrokinetic research and application development.},

We hypothesized that disruption of the interaction of MM cells with their BM milieu would lead to their sensitization to therapeutic agents such as bortezomib, melphalan, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone. We report that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 induces disruption of the interaction of MM cells with the BM reflected by mobilization of MM cells into the circulation in vivo, with kinetics that differed from that of hematopoietic stem cells. AMD3100 enhanced sensitivity of MM cell to multiple therapeutic agents in vitro by disrupting adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Moreover, AMD3100 increased mobilization of MM cells to the circulation in vivo, increased the ratio of apoptotic circulating MM cells, and enhanced the tumor reduction induced by bortezomib. Mechanistically, AMD3100 significantly inhibited Akt phosphorylation and enhanced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage as a result of bortezomib, in the presence of BMSCs in coculture. These experiments provide a proof of concept for the use of agents that disrupt interaction with the microenvironment for enhancement of efficacy of cytotoxic agents in cancer therapy.},

One of the major limitations has been the insufficient survival of an adequate mass of transplanted cells. This study investigates a novel method of dynamic seeding and culture of hepatocytes in a flow perfusion system. In experiment I, hepatocytes were flow-seeded onto PGA scaffolds and cultured in a flow perfusion system for 24 h. Overall metabolic activity and distribution of cells were assessed by their ability to reduce MTT. DNA quantification was used to determine the number of cells attached. Culture medium was analyzed for albumin content. In Experiment II, hepatocyte/polymer constructs were cultured in a perfusion system for 2 and 7 days. The constructs were examined by SEM and histology. Culture medium was analyzed for albumin. In experiment I, an average of 4.4 X 10(6) cells attached to the scaffolds by DNA quantification. Cells maintained a high metabolic activity and secreted albumin at a rate of 13 pg/cell/day. In experiment II, SEM demonstrated successful attachment of hepatocytes on the scaffolds after 2 and 7 days. Cells appeared healthy on histology and maintained a high rate of albumin secretion through day 7. Hepatocytes can be dynamically seeded onto biodegradable polymers and survive with a high rate of albumin synthesis in the flow perfusion culture system.},

	Abstract = {Currently, 9 out of 10 experimental drugs fail in clinical studies. This has caused a 40{\%} plunge in the number of drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2005. It has been suggested that the mechanistic differences between human diseases modeled in animals (mostly rodents) and the pathophysiology of human diseases might be one of the critical factors that contribute to drug failure in clinical trials. Rapid progress in the field of human stem cell technology has allowed the in-vitro recreation of human tissue that should complement and expand upon the limitations of cell and animal models currently used to study human diseases and drug toxicity. Recent success in the identification and isolation of human intestinal epithelial stem cells (Lgr5(+)) from the small intestine and colon has led to culture of functional intestinal epithelial units termed organoids or enteroids. Intestinal enteroids are comprised of all four types of normal epithelial cells and develop a crypt-villus differentiation axis. They demonstrate major intestinal physiologic functions, including Na(+) absorption and Cl(-) secretion. This review discusses the recent progress in establishing human enteroids as a model of infectious diarrheal diseases such as cholera, rotavirus, and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, and use of the enteroids to determine ways to correct the diarrhea-induced ion transport abnormalities via drug therapy.},

Tubeless microfluidic devices based on passive pumping are a step towards accessible high throughput microassays, however they are vulnerable to evaporation. In addition to volume loss, evaporation can lead to the generation of small flows. Here, we focus on issues of convection and diffusion for cell culture in microchannels and particularly the transport of soluble factors secreted by cells. We find that even for humidity levels as high as 95{\%}, convection in a passive pumping channel can significantly alter distributions of these factors and that appropriate system design can prevent convection.},

Advantages of this device are that it is simple to manufacture, robust under operation, and drops never come into contact with each other, making it unnecessary to stabilize drops against coalescence. In one method the device can be used to store drops that are created upstream from the storage zone. In the second method the same device can be used to simultaneously create and store drops from a single large continuous fluid stream without resorting to the usual flow focusing or T-junction drop generation processes. Additionally, this device stores all the fluid introduced, including the first amount, with zero waste. Transport of drops in this device depends, however, on whether or not the aqueous drops wet the device walls. Analysis of drop transport in these two cases is presented. Finally, a method for extraction of the drops from the device is also presented, which works best when drops do not wet the walls of the chip.},

Adaptation of this process at the microscale could lead to the rapid and
direct fabrication of micromolds and masks to aid in the development of
microcomponents. This task has been undertaken, and results of the
process indicate it can become an increasingly useful method. The
micromilling process is characterized by milling tools that are
currently in the range from 22-100 {\&}mu;m in diameter and made by the
focused-ion beam machining process. The tools are used in a specially
designed, high-precision milling machine. Results are comparable to
other processes currently used to fabricate mold and mask features. The
micromilling process can create trench-like features with nearly
vertical sidewalls and good smoothness. External corners are sharp and
stepped features can be machined simply by programming those shapes. The
process is direct, and therefore dimensional errors do not accumulate as
can occur with serial fabrication processes},

	Abstract = {Physiological levels of shear stress alter the genetic program of cultured endothelial cells and reduce endothelial cell turnover in vivo. To test the hypothesis that shear stress interferes with programmed cell death, apoptosis was induced in human umbilical venous endothelial cells by growth factor withdrawal or incubation with tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$(TNF$\alpha$) for 18 h. Apoptosis was quantified by ELISA specific for histone-associated DNA fragments and confirmed by demonstrating the specific pattern of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation detected by electrophoresis and immunohistochemical staining. The TNF$\alpha$ (300 U/ml)-mediated increase in DNA fragmentation was completely abrogated by shear stress. Furthermore, shear stress dose-dependently reduced DNA fragmentation induced by growth factor withdrawal with maximal effect at 45 dyn/cm2. Inhibition of the CPP32-like proteases with Ac-DEVD-CHO (100 $\mu$M) revealed similar anti-apoptotic effects. In contrast, CPP32-independent induction of endothelial cell apoptosis by C2-ceramide (50 $\mu$M) was not prevented by shear stress. Thus, we propose that shear stress interferes with common cell death signal transduction involving the CPP32-like protease family and may contribute to endothelial cell integrity by inhibition of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Point-of-care diagnostics will strongly benefit from miniaturization based on microfluidics because microfluidics integrate functions that can together preserve valuable samples and reagents, increase sensitivity of a test, and accelerate mass transport limited reactions. But a main challenge is to incorporate reagents into microfluidics and to make microfluidics simple to use. Here, we integrate microfluidic functional elements, some of which were developed earlier, and reagents such as detection antibodies (dAbs), capture antibodies (cAbs) and analyte molecules for making one-step immunoassays: the integrated device only requires the addition of sample to trigger a cascade of events powered by capillary forces for effecting a sandwich immunoassay that is read using a fluorescence microscope. The microfluidic elements comprise a sample collector, delay valves, flow resistors, a deposition zone for dAbs, a reaction chamber sealed with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, and a capillary pump and vents. Parameters for depositing 3.6 nL of a solution of dAb on the chip using an inkjet are optimized and the PDMS substrate is patterned with analytes, which provide a positive control, and cAbs. Various storage conditions of the patterned PDMS are investigated for up to 6 months revealing that storage with a desiccant preserved at least 51{\%} of the activity of the cAbs. C-reactive protein (CRP), a general inflammation and cardiac marker, is detected using this one-step chip using only 5 µL of human serum by measuring fluorescent signals from 30 × 100 µm2 areas of the PDMS substrate in the wet reaction chamber. The one-step chip can detect CRP at a concentration of 10 ng mL−1 in less than 3 min and below 1 ng mL−1 within 14 min. The work presented here may spur the adoption of fluorescence immunoassays using capillary driven microfluidics and PDMS substrates for point-of-care diagnostics.},

	Abstract = {The cancer microenvironment, which incorporates interactions with stromal cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and other tumor cells in a 3-dimensional (3D) context, has been implicated in every stage of cancer development, including growth of the primary tumor, metastatic spread, and response to treatment. Our understanding of the tumor microenvironment and our ability to develop new therapies would greatly benefit from tools that allow us to systematically probe microenvironmental cues within a 3D context. Here, we leveraged recent advances in microfluidic technology to develop a platform for high-throughput fabrication of tunable cellular microniches ("microtissues") that allow us to probe tumor cell response to a range of microenvironmental cues, including ECM, soluble factors, and stromal cells, all in 3D. We further combine this tunable microniche platform with rapid, flow-based population level analysis (n {\textgreater} 500), which permits analysis and sorting of microtissue populations both pre- and post-culture by a range of parameters, including proliferation and homotypic or heterotypic cell density. We used this platform to demonstrate differential responses of lung adenocarcinoma cells to a selection of ECM molecules and soluble factors. The cells exhibited enhanced or reduced proliferation when encapsulated in fibronectin- or collagen-1-containing microtissues, respectively, and they showed reduced proliferation in the presence of TGF-$\beta$, an effect that we did not observe in monolayer culture. We also measured tumor cell response to a panel of drug targets and found, in contrast to monolayer culture, specific sensitivity of tumor cells to TGF$\beta$R2 inhibitors, implying that TGF-$\beta$ has an anti-proliferative affect that is unique to the 3D context and that this effect is mediated by TGF$\beta$R2. These findings highlight the importance of the microenvironmental context in therapeutic development and that the platform we present here allows the high-throughput study of tumor response to drugs as well as basic tumor biology in well-defined microenvironmental niches.},

	Abstract = {Development of an in vitro living cell-based model of the intestine that mimics the mechanical, structural, absorptive, transport and pathophysiological properties of the human gut along with its crucial microbial symbionts could accelerate pharmaceutical development, and potentially replace animal testing. Here, we describe a biomimetic 'human gut-on-a-chip' microdevice composed of two microfluidic channels separated by a porous flexible membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) and lined by human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells that mimics the complex structure and physiology of living intestine. The gut microenvironment is recreated by flowing fluid at a low rate (30 $\mu$L h(-1)) producing low shear stress (0.02 dyne cm(-2)) over the microchannels, and by exerting cyclic strain (10{\%}; 0.15 Hz) that mimics physiological peristaltic motions. Under these conditions, a columnar epithelium develops that polarizes rapidly, spontaneously grows into folds that recapitulate the structure of intestinal villi, and forms a high integrity barrier to small molecules that better mimics whole intestine than cells in cultured in static Transwell models. In addition, a normal intestinal microbe (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) can be successfully co-cultured for extended periods ({\textgreater}1 week) on the luminal surface of the cultured epithelium without compromising epithelial cell viability, and this actually improves barrier function as previously observed in humans. Thus, this gut-on-a-chip recapitulates multiple dynamic physical and functional features of human intestine that are critical for its function within a controlled microfluidic environment that is amenable for transport, absorption, and toxicity studies, and hence it should have great value for drug testing as well as development of novel intestinal disease models.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biodegradable scaffolds have been used for regenerating the small intestine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of small intestinal submucosa (SIS) as scaffolds for intestinal regeneration in a rat model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tubular one-ply or four-ply SIS was interposed between isolated jejunal segments in rats. The scaffolds were harvested at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after implantation, and the specimens were examined grossly and histologically.

RESULTS: Significant contractions were observed in SIS scaffolds after implantation. The one-ply SIS contracted to 44{\%} of its initial length at 2 weeks and continued to contract to 6{\%} of its initial length at 8 weeks. The contraction of four-ply SIS scaffolds was less than that of the one-ply SIS, reaching 29{\%} of its initial length at 8 weeks. Minimal epithelial and smooth muscular regeneration was observed in the SIS scaffolds after implantation.

CONCLUSIONS: A significant shrinkage was observed in the SIS scaffolds after implantation. Although the four-ply SIS contracted less than the one-ply SIS, neither scaffold supported significant amount of intestinal regeneration.},

The tool life of cemented carbide cutting tools is greatly improved by diamond coating, and typically more than 10 times the tool life is obtained. In this report we will present cutting performances of diamond-coated inserts, twist drills, square end mills and ball nose end mills. Diamond films are usually deposited more than 10 pm thick to make tool life longer, since tool life is directly related to film thickness. However, increased film thickness caused many problems with cutting performance. The most severe problem was the decrease in the transverse rupture strength of the diamond-coated substrates. Because of this effect, the diamond-coated insert used under high speed and intermittent cutting conditions was supposed to suffer chipping easily.},

Here, we present a platform that extends the hanging-drop technology, used for multi-cellular spheroid formation, to multifunctional complex microfluidic networks. Engineered as completely open, 'hanging' microfluidic system at the bottom of a substrate, the platform features high flexibility in microtissue arrangements and interconnections, while fabrication is simple and operation robust. Multiple spheroids of different cell types are formed in parallel on the same platform; the different tissues are then connected in physiological order for multi-tissue experiments through reconfiguration of the fluidic network. Liquid flow is precisely controlled through the hanging drops, which enable nutrient supply, substance dosage and inter-organ metabolic communication. The possibility to perform parallelized microtissue formation on the same chip that is subsequently used for complex multi-tissue experiments renders the developed platform a promising technology for 'body-on-a-chip'-related research.},

To highlight the intrinsic advantages of this method, three important applications are detailed: (i) we show that both aqueous and organic droplets can be produced and stored in stickers without any specific surface coating.

It has remained challenging to address the molecular details of these transitions and whether they apply to humans, due to the lack of culture conditions that recapitulate prostate gland architecture. Here, we describe a 3D culture system that supports long-term expansion of primary mouse and human prostate organoids, composed of fully differentiated CK5+ basal and CK8+ luminal cells. Organoids are genetically stable, reconstitute prostate glands in recombination assays, and can be experimentally manipulated. Single human luminal and basal cells give rise to organoids, yet luminal-cell-derived organoids more closely resemble prostate glands. These data support a luminal multilineage progenitor cell model for prostate tissue and establish a robust, scalable system for mechanistic studies.},

	Abstract = {Chronic inflammation including B-cell activation is commonly observed in both inherited (Gaucher disease [GD]) and acquired disorders of lipid metabolism. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying B-cell activation in these settings remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that $\beta$-glucosylceramide 22:0 ($\beta$GL1-22) and glucosylsphingosine (LGL1), 2 major sphingolipids accumulated in GD, can be recognized by a distinct subset of CD1d-restricted human and murine type II natural killer T (NKT) cells. Human $\beta$GL1-22- and LGL1-reactive CD1d tetramer-positive T cells have a distinct T-cell receptor usage and genomic and cytokine profiles compared with the classical type I NKT cells. In contrast to type I NKT cells, $\beta$GL1-22- and LGL1-specific NKT cells constitutively express T-follicular helper (TFH) phenotype. Injection of these lipids leads to an increase in respective lipid-specific type II NKT cells in vivo and downstream induction of germinal center B cells, hypergammaglobulinemia, and production of antilipid antibodies. Human $\beta$GL1-22- and LGL1-specific NKT cells can provide efficient cognate help to B cells in vitro. Frequency of LGL1-specific T cells in GD mouse models and patients correlates with disease activity and therapeutic response. Our studies identify a novel type II NKT-mediated pathway for glucosphingolipid-mediated dysregulation of humoral immunity and increased risk of B-cell malignancy observed in metabolic lipid disorders.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by a clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow, which is accompanied by the development of osteolytic lesions and/or diffuse osteopenia. The intricate bi-directional interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment plays a critical role in sustaining the growth and survival of myeloma cells during tumor progression. Identification and functional analysis of the (adhesion) molecules involved in this interaction will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Multiple myeloma cell lines and patients' samples were analyzed for expression of the adhesion molecule N-cadherin by immunoblotting, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry and expression microarray. In addition, by means of blocking antibodies and inducible RNA interference we studied the functional consequence of N-cadherin expression for the myeloma cells, by analysis of adhesion, migration and growth, and for the bone marrow microenvironment, by analysis of osteogenic differentiation.

RESULTS: The malignant plasma cells in approximately half of the multiple myeloma patients, belonging to specific genetic subgroups, aberrantly expressed the homophilic adhesion molecule N-cad-herin. N-cadherin-mediated cell-substrate or homotypic cell-cell adhesion did not contribute to myeloma cell growth in vitro. However, N-cadherin directly mediated the bone marrow localization/retention of myeloma cells in vivo, and facilitated a close interaction between myeloma cells and N-cadherin-positive osteoblasts. Furthermore, this N-cadherin-mediated interaction contributed to the ability of myeloma cells to inhibit osteoblastogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data show that myeloma cells frequently display aberrant expression of N-cadherin and that N-cadherin mediates the interaction of myeloma cells with the bone marrow microenvironment, in particular the osteoblasts. This N-cadherin-mediated interaction inhibits osteoblast differentiation and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of myeloma bone disease.},

	Abstract = {Immunological dysregulation is the cause of many non-infectious human diseases such as autoimmunity, allergy and cancer. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the host immune system and microorganisms, both symbiotic and pathogenic. In this Review we discuss findings indicating that developmental aspects of the adaptive immune system are influenced by bacterial colonization of the gut. We also highlight the molecular pathways that mediate host-symbiont interactions that regulate proper immune function. Finally, we present recent evidence to support that disturbances in the bacterial microbiota result in dysregulation of adaptive immune cells, and this may underlie disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. This raises the possibility that the mammalian immune system, which seems to be designed to control microorganisms, is in fact controlled by microorganisms.},

	Abstract = {The human superorganism is a conglomerate of mammalian and microbial cells, with the latter estimated to outnumber the former by ten to one and the microbial genetic repertoire (microbiome) to be approximately 100-times greater than that of the human host. Given the ability of the immune response to rapidly counter infectious agents, it is striking that such a large density of microbes can exist in a state of synergy within the human host. This is particularly true of the distal gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which houses up to 1000 distinct bacterial species and an estimated excess of 1 x 10(14) microorganisms. An ever-increasing body of evidence implicates the GI microbiota in defining states of health and disease. Here, we review the literature in adult and pediatric GI microbiome studies, the emerging links between microbial community structure, function, infection and disease, and the approaches to manipulate this crucial ecosystem to improve host health.},

@article{Lee2010a,
	Abstract = {In order to offer an easier way to study interactions between multiple cellular populations, we have developed a novel method to precisely place cells in a variety of nonoverlapping patterns using surface tension in laterally open microchannels. Our design is fundamentally different from previous strategies such as compartmentalization, stamping, stenciling, or mechanical approaches. It relies on capillary action or the propensity for liquid to move more readily through narrow spaces as a result of surface tension. Until now, capillary based patterning has been limited to coating chemically isolated areas. Here, we demonstrate, through use of surface tension and controlled flooding, that it is possible to pattern multiple cells and proteins using laterally open channels in a variety of designs. We demonstrate the relevance of the concept by coculturing different mammalian cell types and evaluating the behavior of engineered quorum sensing circuits in E. coli. In the future, we believe the laterally open channel designs shown here can be useful for rapidly creating and studying cellular ecologies using simple pipetting.},

@article{Kim2011,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a microfluidic device for the on-chip differentiation of an embryoid body (EB) formed in a microwell via 3-dimensional cultures of mouse embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells. The device adjusted the size of the EB by fluid volume, differentiated the EB by chemical treatment, and evaluated its effects in EC cells by on-chip immunostaining. A microfluidic resistance network was designed to control the size of the embryoid body. The duration time and flow rate into each microwell regulated the initial number of trapped cells in order to adjust the size of the EB. The docked cells were aggregated and formed a spherical EB on the non-adherent surface of the culture chip for 3 days. The EC cells in the EB were then differentiated into diverse cell lineages without attachment for an additional 4 days; meanwhile, retinoic acid (RA) was applied without serum to direct the cells into early neuronal lineage. On-chip immunostaining of the EB in the microwell with a neuronal marker was conducted to assess the differentiation-inducing ability of RA. The effect of RA on neuronal differentiation was analyzed with confocal microscopic images of the TuJ1 marker. The RA-treated cells expressed more neuronal markers and appeared as mature neuronal cells with long neurites. The fluorescence intensity of the TuJ1 in the RA-treated EB was twice that observed in the non-treated EB on day 5. It was demonstrated that the pre-screening of inducing chemicals on the early neuronal differentiation of EC cells in a single microfluidic chip was indeed feasible. This chip is expected to constitute a useful tool for assessing the early differentiation of ES cells without attachment, and is also expected to prove useful as an anti-cancer drug test platform for the cytotoxicity assay with cellular spheroids.},

@article{Yamamoto2003,
	Abstract = {Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), circulating in peripheral blood, migrate toward target tissue, differentiate, and contribute to the formation of new vessels. In this study, we report that shear stress generated by blood flow or tissue fluid flow can accelerate the proliferation, differentiation, and capillary-like tube formation of EPCs. When EPCs cultured from human peripheral blood were subjected to laminar shear stress, the cells elongated and oriented their long axes in the direction of flow. The cell density of the EPCs exposed to shear stress was higher, and a larger percentage of these cells were in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, compared with EPCs cultured under static conditions. Shear stress markedly increased the EPC expression of two vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor and fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, and an intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular endothelial-cadherin, at both the protein and mRNA levels. Assays for tube formation in the collagen gels showed that the shear-stressed EPCs formed tubelike structures and developed an extensive tubular network significantly faster than the static controls. These findings suggest that EPCs are sensitive to shear stress and that their vasculogenic activities may be modulated by shear stress.},

@article{Meads2008,
	Abstract = {The bone marrow microenvironment facilitates the survival, differentiation, and proliferation of hematopoietic cells. These cells are supported by fibroblast-like bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts which secrete soluble factors and extracellular matrix proteins that mediate these functions. This rich environment serves as a safe haven not only for normal and malignant hematopoietic cells, but also for epithelial tumor cells that metastasize to bone, offering protection from chemotherapeutic agents by common mechanisms. Soluble factors produced in the bone marrow, such as stromal cell-derived factor-1 and interleukin-6, mediate homing, survival, and proliferation of tumor cells, and integrin-mediated adhesion sequesters tumor cells to this protective niche. Environment-mediated drug resistance includes a combination of soluble factors and adhesion, and can be subdivided into soluble factor-mediated drug resistance and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance. Because it is induced immediately by the microenvironment and is independent of epigenetic or genetic changes caused by the selective pressure of drug exposure, environment-mediated drug resistance is a form of de novo drug resistance. In this form of drug resistance, tumor cells are transiently and reversibly protected from apoptosis induced by both chemotherapy and physiologic mediators of cell death. This protection allows tumor cells to survive the insult of chemotherapy, leading to minimal residual disease, and thereby increases the probability for the development of acquired drug resistance.},

Statistical clustering techniques segregated MicroC(3) responses into two groups which correctly identified all seventeen patients as either clinically responsive or non-responsive to bortezomib-containing therapies. In contrast, when the same patient MM samples were analyzed in the absence of the CD138(-) cells (monoculture), the tumor cell responses did not segregate into clinical response clusters.

	Abstract = {The cellular microenvironment plays a critical role in shaping and directing the process of communication between the cells. Soluble signals are responsible for many cellular behaviors such as cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Despite the importance of soluble signals, canonical methods are not well suited to the study of soluble factor interactions between multiple cell types. Macro-scale technology often puts cells into a convective environment that can wash away and dilute soluble signals from their targets, minimizing local concentrations of important factors. In addition, current methods such as transwells, require large numbers of cells and are limited to studying just two cell types. Here, we present data supporting the use of microchannels to study soluble factor signaling providing improved sensitivity as well as the ability to move beyond existing co-culture and conditioned medium paradigms. In addition, we present data suggesting that microculture can be used to unmask effects of population demographics. In this example the data support the hypothesis that a growth promoting subpopulation of cells exists in the mouse mammary gland.},

	Abstract = {Generating perfusable 3D microvessels in vitro is an important goal for tissue engineering, as well as for reliable modelling of blood vessel function. To date, in vitro blood vessel models have not been able to accurately reproduce the dynamics and responses of endothelial cells to grow perfusable and functional 3D vascular networks. Here we describe a microfluidic-based platform whereby we model natural cellular programs found during normal development and angiogenesis to form perfusable networks of intact 3D microvessels as well as tumor vasculatures based on the spatially controlled co-culture of endothelial cells with stromal fibroblasts, pericytes or cancer cells. The microvessels possess the characteristic morphological and biochemical markers of in vivo blood vessels, and exhibit strong barrier function and long-term stability. An open, unobstructed microvasculature allows the delivery of nutrients, chemical compounds, biomolecules and cell suspensions, as well as flow-induced mechanical stimuli into the luminal space of the endothelium, and exhibits faithful responses to physiological shear stress as demonstrated by cytoskeleton rearrangement and increased nitric oxide synthesis. This simple and versatile platform provides a wide range of applications in vascular physiology studies as well as in developing vascularized organ-on-a-chip and human disease models for pharmaceutical screening.},

	Abstract = {As different implant abutments are introduced to obtain a sufficient soft tissue barrier, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of three different surface modifications of densely sintered high-purity aluminium oxide on morphology, attachment and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were cultured on pressed aluminium oxide, milled, and then sintered to full density (1), on pressed, densely sintered (2), and on pressed, densely sintered and then polished surfaces (3). The different surfaces were analyzed using a confocal laser scanner, an atomic force microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The cell profile areas were measured using a semiautomatic interactive image analyzer and the figures were expressed as percent of attachment. The polished specimens had the smoothest surfaces and the roughest were the milled surfaces in terms of height deviation. No difference was found in the spacing between the peaks on the polished surfaces compared to the milled surfaces. Fibroblasts on the milled ceramic appeared to follow the direction of the fine irregularities on the surface. The analyses showed the polished surfaces had significantly higher percentages of initial cell attachment than the other surfaces (P {\textless} 0.05). After 3 days of cell culture, significantly more cells were attached to the milled and sintered surfaces than to the polished one, possibly indicating higher proliferation capacity on those types of surfaces.},

@article{Du2009,
	Abstract = {The SlipChip is a microfluidic device designed to perform multiplexed microfluidic reactions without pumps or valves. The device has two plates in close contact. The bottom plate contains wells preloaded with many reagents; in this paper plates with 48 reagents were used. These wells are covered by the top plate that acts as a lid for the wells with reagents. The device also has a fluidic path, composed of ducts in the bottom plate and wells in the top plate, which is connected only when the top and bottom plate are aligned in a specific configuration. Sample can be added into the fluidic path, filling both wells and ducts. Then, the top plate is "slipped", or moved, relative to the bottom plate so the complementary patterns of wells in both plates overlap, exposing the sample-containing wells of the top plate to the reagent-containing wells of the bottom plate, and enabling diffusion and reactions. Between the two plates, a lubricating layer of fluorocarbon was used to facilitate relative motion of the plates. This paper implements this approach on a nanoliter scale using devices fabricated in glass. Stability of preloaded solutions, control of loading, and lack of cross-contamination were tested using fluorescent dyes. Functionality of the device was illustrated via crystallization of a model membrane protein. Fabrication of this device is simple and does not require a bonding step. This device requires no pumps or valves and is applicable to resource-poor settings. Overall, this device should be valuable for multiplexed applications that require exposing one sample to many reagents in small volumes. One may think of the SlipChip as an easy-to-use analogue of a preloaded multi-well plate, or a preloaded liquid-phase microarray.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which multiple myeloma (MM) cells migrate and home to the bone marrow are not well understood. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of the chemokine SDF-1 (CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 on the migration and homing of MM cells. We demonstrated that CXCR4 is differentially expressed at high levels in the peripheral blood and is down-regulated in the bone marrow in response to high levels of SDF-1. SDF-1 induced motility, internalization, and cytoskeletal rearrangement in MM cells evidenced by confocal microscopy. The specific CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 and the anti-CXCR4 antibody MAB171 inhibited the migration of MM cells in vitro. CXCR4 knockdown experiments demonstrated that SDF-1-dependent migration was regulated by the P13K and ERK/ MAPK pathways but not by p38 MAPK. In addition, we demonstrated that AMD3100 inhibited the homing of MM cells to the bone marrow niches using in vivo flow cytometry, in vivo confocal microscopy, and whole body bioluminescence imaging. This study, therefore, demonstrates that SDF-1/CXCR4 is a critical regulator of MM homing and that it provides the framework for inhibitors of this pathway to be used in future clinical trials to abrogate MM trafficking.},

	Abstract = {Measures of cellular gene expression or behavior, when performed on individual cells, inevitably reveal a diversity of behaviors and outcomes that can correlate with normal or diseased states. For virus infections, the potential diversity of outcomes are pushed to an extreme, where measures of infection reflect features of the specific infecting virus particle, the individual host cell, as well as interactions between viral and cellular components. Single-cell measures, while revealing, still often rely on specialized fluid handling capabilities, employ end-point measures, and remain labor-intensive to perform. To address these limitations, we consider a new microwell-based device that uses simple pipette-based fluid handling to isolate individual cells. Our design allows different experimental conditions to be implemented in a single device, permitting easier and more standardized protocols. Further, we utilize a recently reported dual-color fluorescent reporter system that provides dynamic readouts of viral and cellular gene expression during single-cell infections by vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, we develop and show how free, open-source software can enable streamlined data management and batch image analysis. Here we validate the integration of the device and software using the reporter system to demonstrate unique single-cell dynamic measures of cellular responses to viral infection.},

In this paper we introduce a compact on-chip pumping approach for flow control in hanging-drop networks. The pump includes one pneumatic chamber located directly above one of the hanging drops and uses the surface tension at the liquid--air-interface for flow actuation. Control of the pneumatic protocol provides a wide range of unidirectional pulsatile and continuous flow profiles. With the proposed concept several independent hanging-drop networks can be operated in parallel with only one single pneumatic actuation line at high fidelity. Closed-loop medium circulation between different organ models for multi-tissue formats and multiple simultaneous assays in parallel are possible. Finally, we implemented a real-time feedback control-loop of the pump actuation based on the beating of a human iPS-derived cardiac microtissue cultured in the same system. This configuration allows for simulating physiological effects on the heart and their impact on flow circulation between the organ models on chip.},

	Abstract = {Although used in academic research for several decades, 3D culture models have long been regarded expensive, cumbersome and unnecessary in drug development processes. Technical advances, coupled with recent observations showing that gene expression in 3D is much closer to clinical expression profiles than those seen in 2D, have renewed attention and generated hope in the feasibility of maturing organotypic 3D systems to therapy test platforms with greater power to predict clinical efficacies. Here we describe a standardized setup for reproducible, easy-handling culture, treatment and routine analysis of multicellular spheroids, the classical 3D culture system resembling many aspects of the pathophysiological situation in human tumor tissue. We discuss essential conceptual and practical considerations for an adequate establishment and use of spheroid-based drug screening platforms and also provide a list of human carcinoma cell lines, partly on the basis of the NCI-DTP 60-cell line screen, that produce treatable spheroids under identical culture conditions. In contrast to many other settings with which to achieve similar results, the protocol is particularly useful to be integrated into standardized large-scale drug test routines as it requires a minimum number of defined spheroids and a limited amount of drug. The estimated time to run the complete screening protocol described herein--including spheroid initiation, drug treatment and determination of the analytical end points (spheroid integrity, and cell survival through the acid phosphatase assay)--is about 170 h. Monitoring of spheroid growth kinetics to determine growth delay and regrowth, respectively, after drug treatment requires long-term culturing ({\textgreater} or =14 d).},

	Abstract = {Biomaterials interact with the biological environment at their surface, making accurate biophysical characterization of the surface crucially important for understanding subsequent biological effects. In this study, the surface of polystyrene (PS) was systematically altered in order to determine the effect of plasma treatment and surface roughness on cell adhesion and spreading. Surfaces with water contact angle from hydrophilic (12$\,^{\circ}$) to superhydrophobic (155$\,^{\circ}$) were obtained through a combination of modifying surface roughness (R (a)), the deposition of siloxane coatings and the fluorination of the PS surface. R (a) values in the range of 19-2365 nm were obtained by grinding the PS surface. The nanometer-thick siloxane coatings were deposited using an atmospheric pressure plasma system, while the fluorination of the PS was carried out using a low-pressure radio frequency (RF) plasma. The siloxane coatings were obtained using a liquid poly(dimethylsiloxane) precursor that was nebulized into helium or helium/oxygen plasmas. Water contact angles in the range of 12-122$\,^{\circ}$ were obtained with these coatings. Cell adhesion studies were carried out using human MG63 osteosarcoma cells. It was observed that higher polymer surface roughness enhanced cell adhesion, but had a negative effect on cell spreading. Optimum cell adhesion was observed at ∼64$\,^{\circ}$ for the siloxane coatings, with a decrease in adhesion observed for the more hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings. This decrease in cell adhesion with an increase in hydrophobicity was also observed for the fluorinated PS surfaces with water contact angles in the range of 110-155$\,^{\circ}$.},

	Abstract = {Cellular inflammation of the airways with eosinophils and neutrophils is a characteristic feature of asthma and is considered relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. Studies of large numbers of subjects with well-characterized asthma in recent years has resulted in new insights about the clinical and pathologic correlates of eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation in asthma. For example, eosinophilic asthma is a distinct phenotype of asthma that is associated pathologically by thickening of the basement membrane zone and pharmacologically by corticosteroid responsiveness. In contrast, noneosinophilic asthma, a sizeable subgroup of asthma that includes patients with severe disease, is not characterized by thickening of the basement membrane zone, and it appears to be relatively corticosteroid resistant. Eosinophilic and neutrophilic asthma are not mutually exclusive subtypes of asthma. Rather, neutrophils accumulate in the airways in patients with asthma with more severe airflow obstruction, where eosinophils may also be present in excess. In addition, neutrophils are prominent in airway secretions during acute severe asthma exacerbations, where it is possible that they have roles in both the initiation and resolution of attacks. These insights about the relationships between cellular inflammation and disease phenotypes of asthma support the concept that different subgroups of patients with asthma, despite clinically similar features, can be defined by specific cellular and molecular markers. The promise now is that these markers will ultimately guide personalized treatment programs.},

	Abstract = {In order to effectively treat obesity, it must be better understood at the cellular level with respect to metabolic state and environmental stress. However, current two-dimensional (2D) in vitro cell culture methods do not represent the in vivo adipose tissue appropriately due to the absence of complex architecture and cellular signaling. Conversely, 3D in vitro cultures have been reported to have optimal results mimicking the adipose tissue in vivo. The main aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a novel conjugate of a genetically engineered polymer, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) and a synthetic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), toward creating a 3D preadipocyte culture system. We then used this 3D culture model to study the preadipocyte differentiation and adipocyte maintenance processes when subjected to various dosages of nutritionally relevant free fatty acids with respect to total DNA and protein content, cell viability, and intracellular triglyceride accumulation. Our results showed that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes cultured on the ELP-PEI surface formed 3D spheroids within 72 h, whereas the cells cultured on unmodified tissue culture polystyrene surfaces remained in monolayer configuration. Significant statistical differences were discovered between the 3D spheroid and 2D monolayer culture with respect to the DNA and protein content, fatty acid consumption, and triglyceride accumulation, indicating differences in cellular response. Results indicated that the 3D culture may be a more sensitive modeling technique for in vitro adipocyte culture and provides a platform for future evaluation of 3D in vitro adipocyte function.},

@article{Besson2006,
	Abstract = {This work describes how selective patterning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas inside microchannels of microfluidic devices can be achieved by combining well-known chemical protocols and standard photolithography equipment (365 nm). Two techniques have been performed and compared. The first technique is based on the preparation of self-assembled monolayers of photocleavable organosilane and the second one on photoassisted grafting (365 nm) of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a silicon or glass substrate. In the first case, we begin with monolayers carrying an o-nitrobenzyl function (hydrophobic area) that is photochemically cleaved, revealing a carboxylic acid group (hydrophilic area). The problem is that the energy necessary to cleave this monolayer is too high and the reaction time is more than 1 h with 50 mW/cm(2) irradiation flux. To overcome this practical disadvantage, we propose another approach that is based on the thiol-ene reaction with benzophenone as photoinitiator. In this approach, a monolayer of mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS) is prepared first. Subsequently, a hydrocarbon chain is photografted locally onto the thiol layer, forming a hydrophobic surface while the reminding unmodified thiol surface is oxidized into sulfonic acid (hydrophilic area). We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and synthesized high-quality self-assembled monolayers by UV grafting with an irradiation time of 30 s at 365 nm (50 mW/cm(2)). The modified surfaces have been characterized by contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), AFM, and multiple internal reflection infrared spectroscopy (MIR-FTIR). The difference in the contact angles on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces reached a remarkable 77 degrees. We have also demonstrated that this method is compatible with selective surface grafting inside microfluidic channels.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for programming the flow rate of liquids inside open microfluidic networks (MFNs). A MFN comprises a number of independent flow paths, each of which starts with an open filling port, has a sealed microchannel in which assays can be performed, and an open capillary pump (CP). The MFN is placed over Peltier elements and its flow paths initially fill owing to capillary forces when liquids are added to the filling ports. A cooling Peltier element underneath the filling ports dynamically prevents evaporation in all filling ports using the ambient temperature and relative humidity as inputs. Another Peltier element underneath the CPs heats the pumps thereby inducing evaporation in the CPs and setting the flow rate in the microchannels. This method achieves flow rates in the microchannels ranging from ∼1.2 nL s−1 to ∼30 pL s−1, and is able to keep 90{\%} of a 0.6 µL solution placed in an open filling port for 60 min. This simple and efficient method should be applicable to numerous assays or chemical reactions that require small and precise flow of liquids and reagents inside microfluidics.},

@article{Grimes2014,
	Abstract = {Hypoxia occurs when oxygen levels within a tissue drop below normal physiological levels. In tumours, hypoxia is associated with poor prognosis, increased likelihood of metastasis and resistance to therapy. Imaging techniques, for example, positron emission tomography, are increasingly used in the monitoring of tumour hypoxia and have the potential to help in the planning of radiotherapy. For this application, improved understanding of the link between image contrast and quantitative underlying oxygen distribution would be very useful. Mathematical models of tissue hypoxia and image formation can help understand this. Hypoxia is caused by an imbalance between vascular supply and tissue demand. While much work has been dedicated to the quantitative description of tumour vascular networks, consideration of tumour oxygen consumption is largely neglected. Oxidative respiration in standard two-dimensional cell culture has been widely studied. However, two-dimensional culture fails to capture the complexities of growing three-dimensional tissue which could impact on the oxygen usage. In this study, we build on previous descriptions of oxygen consumption and diffusion in three-dimensional tumour spheroids and present a method for estimating rates of oxygen consumption from spheroids, validated using stained spheroid sections. Methods for estimating the local partial pressure of oxygen, the diffusion limit and the extents of the necrotic core, hypoxic region and proliferating rim are also derived. These are validated using experimental data from DLD1 spheroids at different stages of growth. A relatively constant experimentally derived diffusion limit of 232 $\pm$ 22 $\mu$m and an O2 consumption rate of 7.29 $\pm$ 1.4 × 10(-7) m(3) kg(-1) s(-1) for the spheroids studied was measured, in agreement with laboratory measurements.},

Because a large variety of bacteria and viruses activate NF-kappaB and because the transcription factor regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, immunoreceptors, and cell adhesion molecules, NF-kappaB has often been termed a 'central mediator of the human immune response'. This article contains a complete listing of all NF-kappaB inducers and target genes described to date. The collected data argue that NF-kappaB functions more generally as a central regulator of stress responses. In addition, NF-kappaB activation blocks apoptosis in several cell types. Coupling stress responsiveness and anti-apoptotic pathways through the use of a common transcription factor may result in increased cell survival following stress insults.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional microfluidics holds great promise for large-scale integration of versatile, digitalized, and multitasking fluidic manipulations for biological and clinical applications. Successful translation of microfluidic toolsets to these purposes faces persistent technical challenges, such as reliable system-level packaging, device assembly and alignment, and world-to-chip interface. In this paper, we extended our previously established fit-to-flow (F2F) world-to-chip interconnection scheme to a complete system-level assembly strategy that addresses the three-dimensional microfluidic integration on demand. The modular F2F assembly consists of an interfacial chip, pluggable alignment modules, and multiple monolithic layers of microfluidic channels, through which convoluted three-dimensional microfluidic networks can be easily assembled and readily sealed with the capability of reconfigurable fluid flow. The monolithic laser-micromachining process simplifies and standardizes the fabrication of single-layer pluggable polymeric modules, which can be mass-produced as the renowned Lego({\textregistered}) building blocks. In addition, interlocking features are implemented between the plug-and-play microfluidic chips and the complementary alignment modules through the F2F assembly, resulting in facile and secure alignment with average misalignment of 45 $\mu$m. Importantly, the 3D multilayer microfluidic assembly has a comparable sealing performance as the conventional single-layer devices, providing an average leakage pressure of 38.47 kPa. The modular reconfigurability of the system-level reversible packaging concept has been demonstrated by re-routing microfluidic flows through interchangeable modular microchannel layers.},

Poly(l-lactic acid) porous membranes of controlled porosity, surface/volume ratio, and crystallinity were prepared with sodium chloride, sodium tartrate or sodium citrate sieved particles. For salt weight fractions of 50 and 60 wt{\%}, asymmetric membranes were formed, independent of salt particle size. When 70--90 wt{\%} salt was used, the membranes were homogeneous with interconnected pores. The membrane properties were independent of the salt type and were only related to the salt weight fraction and particle size. The porosity increased with the salt weight fraction, and the median pore diameter increased as the salt particle size increased. The polymer/salt composite membranes could be quenched or annealed to yield amorphous or semicrystalline foams with desired crystallinity. All foams were 99.9 wt{\%} salt free and had porosities as high as 0.93 and median pore diameters up to 150 $\mu$m.},

	Abstract = {Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were seeded on sub-mm sized collagen cylinders containing embedded umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (UVSMC). These cylindrical "modules" are intended to be used as a vascularized construct, in which HUVEC lined channels are created by the random packing of the modules in situ or within a larger container. Embedding UVSMC cultured in medium containing 10{\%} FBS had an adverse effect on subsequently seeded HUVEC junction morphology; HUVEC/UVSMC co-culturing was done in HUVEC medium (2{\%} FBS with the addition of 0.03 mg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement) as compared to HUVEC seeded on collagen-only modules. In contrast, embedding UVSMC cultured in serum-free medium prior to embedding improved EC junction morphology. Such serum-free culturing, also prevented the UVSMC induced contraction of the collagen modules. On the other hand, embedding serum-free cultured UVSMC promoted HUVEC proliferation and NO secretion compared to those modules embedded with 10{\%} serum cultured UVSMC. These results suggest, not surprisingly, that embedded UVSMC phenotype plays an important role in the seeded HUVEC phenotype, and that the response can be modulated by the UVSMC culture medium serum concentration. These studies were undertaken with a view to using the UVSMC to modulate the thrombogenicity of the HUVEC. Exploration of this outcome awaits further studies directed to understanding the mechanism of the cellular interactions.},

@article{Purushothaman2014,
	Abstract = {Recently, it was discovered that serglycin, a hematopoietic cell proteoglycan, is the major proteoglycan expressed and constitutively secreted by multiple myeloma (MM) cells. High levels of serglycin are present in the bone marrow aspirates of at least 30{\%} of newly diagnosed MM patients. However, its contribution to the pathophysiology of MM is unknown. Here, we show that serglycin knockdown (by ∼85{\%} compared with normal levels), using lentiviral shRNA, dramatically attenuated MM tumor growth in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. Tumors formed from cells deficient in serglycin exhibited diminished levels of hepatocyte growth factor expression and impaired development of blood vessels, indicating that serglycin may affect tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, knockdown of serglycin significantly decreased MM cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells and collagen I. Even though serglycin proteoglycan does not have a transmembrane domain, flow cytometry showed that serglycin is present on the MM cell surface, and attachment to the cell surface is, at least in part, dependent on its chondroitin sulfate side chains. Co-precipitation of serglycin from conditioned medium of MM cells using a CD44-Fc chimera suggests that CD44 is the cell surface-binding partner for serglycin, which therefore may serve as a major ligand for CD44 at various stages during myeloma progression. Finally, we demonstrate that serglycin mRNA expression in MM cells is up-regulated by activin, a predominant cytokine among those increased in MM patients with osteolytic lesions. These studies provide direct evidence for a critical role for serglycin in MM pathogenesis and show that targeting serglycin may provide a novel therapeutic approach for MM.},

Fabricating soft hydrogels into such shapes using conventional techniques has been extremely difficult. Combination of laser ablation and sacrificial molding technique using calcium alginate minimizes the stress associated with separating the mold from the hydrogel structure, and therefore allows fabrication of complex structures without damaging them. As a demonstration of this technique, we have fabricated a microscale collagen structure mimicking the actual density and size of human intestinal villi. Colon carcinoma cell line, Caco-2 cells, was seeded onto the structure and cultured for 3 weeks until the whole structure was covered, forming finger-like structures mimicking the intestinal villi covered with epithelial cells. This method will enable construction of in vitro tissue models with physiologically realistic geometries at microscale resolutions.},

	Abstract = {A key aspect of cancer metastases is the tendency for specific cancer cells to home to defined subsets of secondary organs. Despite these known tendencies, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we develop a microfluidic 3D in vitro model to analyze organ-specific human breast cancer cell extravasation into bone- and muscle-mimicking microenvironments through a microvascular network concentrically wrapped with mural cells. Extravasation rates and microvasculature permeabilities were significantly different in the bone-mimicking microenvironment compared with unconditioned or myoblast containing matrices. Blocking breast cancer cell A3 adenosine receptors resulted in higher extravasation rates of cancer cells into the myoblast-containing matrices compared with untreated cells, suggesting a role for adenosine in reducing extravasation. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our model as a drug screening platform and a promising tool to investigate specific molecular pathways involved in cancer biology, with potential applications to personalized medicine.},

	Abstract = {Although a wealth of knowledge about chemotaxis has accumulated in the past 40 years, these studies have been hampered by the inability of researchers to generate simple linear gradients instantaneously and to maintain them at steady state. Here we describe a device microfabricated by soft lithography and consisting of a network of microfluidic channels that can generate spatially and temporally controlled gradients of chemotactic factors. When human neutrophils are positioned within a microchannel, their migration in simple and complex interleukin-8 (IL-8) gradients can be tested. The cells exhibit strong directional migration toward increasing concentrations of IL-8 in linear gradients. Neutrophil migration halts abruptly when cells encounter a sudden drop in the chemoattractant concentration to zero ("cliff" gradient). When neutrophils are challenged with a gradual increase and decrease in chemoattractant ("hill" gradient), however, the cells traverse the crest of maximum concentration and migrate further before reversing direction. The technique described in this paper provides a robust method to investigate migratory cells under a variety of conditions not accessible to study by earlier techniques.},

	Abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal B-lymphocyte malignancy, which is characterized by the accumulation of terminally differentiated antibody-producing cells in the bone marrow. Because current treatments offer only a median survival of 3 years, investigators continue to search for novel therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Rational drug design is enhanced by understanding MM cell proliferation and key signaling pathways employed. In addition, a model system for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics is critical. Our laboratory has developed MM cell lines to study drug action and resistance, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These cell lines are widely used in MM research. From a single MM patient, three separate cell lines were established that parallel the progression of the disease. These three cell lines, designated MM1.S, MM1.RE, and MM1.RL, can be distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids (GCs). Utilization of these cell lines to study the etiology of MM, effects of chemotherapeutic agents, and development of clinical resistance, will provide us with vital information for the evolution of new and more efficacious therapeutics. The aim of this review is to summarize the morphological, biochemical, and growth characteristics of these cells, and to review the results from investigations of the MM.1 signaling pathways. This information will enhance the study, treatment, and eventual eradication of MM.},

	Abstract = {Obesity and extracellular matrix (ECM) density are considered independent risk and prognostic factors for breast cancer. Whether they are functionally linked is uncertain. We investigated the hypothesis that obesity enhances local myofibroblast content in mammary adipose tissue and that these stromal changes increase malignant potential by enhancing interstitial ECM stiffness. Indeed, mammary fat of both diet- and genetically induced mouse models of obesity were enriched for myofibroblasts and stiffness-promoting ECM components. These differences were related to varied adipose stromal cell (ASC) characteristics because ASCs isolated from obese mice contained more myofibroblasts and deposited denser and stiffer ECMs relative to ASCs from lean control mice. Accordingly, decellularized matrices from obese ASCs stimulated mechanosignaling and thereby the malignant potential of breast cancer cells. Finally, the clinical relevance and translational potential of our findings were supported by analysis of patient specimens and the observation that caloric restriction in a mouse model reduces myofibroblast content in mammary fat. Collectively, these findings suggest that obesity-induced interstitial fibrosis promotes breast tumorigenesis by altering mammary ECM mechanics with important potential implications for anticancer therapies.},

	Abstract = {The role of specific gut microbes in shaping body composition remains unclear. We transplanted fecal microbiota from adult female twin pairs discordant for obesity into germ-free mice fed low-fat mouse chow, as well as diets representing different levels of saturated fat and fruit and vegetable consumption typical of the U.S. diet. Increased total body and fat mass, as well as obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes, were transmissible with uncultured fecal communities and with their corresponding fecal bacterial culture collections. Cohousing mice harboring an obese twin's microbiota (Ob) with mice containing the lean co-twin's microbiota (Ln) prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes in Ob cage mates. Rescue correlated with invasion of specific members of Bacteroidetes from the Ln microbiota into Ob microbiota and was diet-dependent. These findings reveal transmissible, rapid, and modifiable effects of diet-by-microbiota interactions.},

	Abstract = {The development and function of living tissues depends largely on interactions between cells that can vary in both time and space; however, temporal control of cell-cell interaction is experimentally challenging. By using a micromachined silicon substrate with moving parts, we demonstrate the dynamic regulation of cell-cell interactions via direct manipulation of adherent cells with micrometer-scale precision. We thereby achieve mechanical control of both tissue composition and spatial organization. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of this tool in deconstructing the dynamics of intercellular communication between hepatocytes and supportive stromal cells in coculture. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of the hepatocellular phenotype by stroma requires direct contact for a limited time ( approximately hours) followed by a sustained soluble signal that has an effective range of {\textless}400 microm. This platform enables investigation of dynamic cell-cell interaction in a multitude of applications, spanning embryogenesis, homeostasis, and pathogenic processes.},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence supports a role for EphB receptor tyrosine kinases as tumour suppressors in colorectal and prostate cancer. However, it is unclear how these receptors inhibit cancer cell tumorigenicity - an activity that is highly unusual for a family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Here, we report that the EphB4 receptor can behave as a tumour suppressor in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer when stimulated by its ligand, ephrin-B2. In breast cancer cells, EphB4 activates an antioncogenic pathway involving Abl family tyrosine kinases and the Crk adaptor protein. This Abl-Crk pathway inhibits breast cancer cell viability and proliferation in addition to motility and invasion, and also downregulates the pro-invasive matrix metalloprotease, MMP-2. Consistent with these effects, EphB4 and the Abl-Crk pathway are constitutively active in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. These findings identify a novel Eph receptor signalling pathway with tumour-suppressor activity and predict that therapeutic intervention to activate EphB4 signalling will inhibit tumour progression.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a pumpless cell culture chip, where a constant-rate medium perfusion is achieved by balanced droplet dispensing. Previous pumpless cell culture chips, where the gravity-driven flow is induced by gradually decreasing the hydraulic-head difference, $\Delta$h, between source and drain reservoirs, result in a decreasing perfusion-rate. However, the present pumpless cell culture chip, where autonomous droplet dispensers are integrated on the source reservoirs, results in a constant perfusion-rate using a constant $\Delta$h maintained by balanced droplet dispensing between the source-inlet and the drain-outlet. In the experimental study, constant perfusion-rates of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 $\mu$l min(-1) are obtained by $\Delta$h of 38, 76, and 114 mm, respectively. At the constant perfusion-rate (Q=0.2 $\mu$l min(-1)), H358 lung cancer cells show the maximum growth-rate of 57.8 $\pm$ 21.1{\%} d(-1), which is 1.9 times higher than the 30.2 $\pm$ 10.3{\%} d(-1) of the static culture. At a perfusion-rate varying between 0.1-0.3 $\mu$l min(-1) (average=0.2 $\mu$l min(-1)), however, the H358 cells show a growth-rate of 46.9 $\pm$ 8.3{\%} d(-1), which is lower than that of the constant Q of 0.2 $\mu$l min(-1). The constant-rate perfusion culture (Q=0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 $\mu$l min(-1)) also results in an average cell viability of 89.2{\%}, which is higher than 75.9{\%} of the static culture. This pumpless cell culture chip offers a favorable environment to cells with a high growth-rate and viability, thus having potential for use in cell-based bio-assays.},

@article{Dahabreh2012,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) and watchful waiting (WW) have been proposed as management strategies for low-risk, localized prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: To systematically review strategies for observational management of prostate cancer (AS or WW), factors affecting their utilization, and comparative effectiveness of observational management versus immediate treatment with curative intent.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases (from inception to August 2011).

STUDY SELECTION: Screened abstracts and reviewed full-text publications to identify eligible studies.

DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted data, and another verified quantitative data. Two independent reviewers rated study quality and strength of evidence for comparative effectiveness.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixteen independent cohorts defined AS, 42 studies evaluated factors that affect the use of observational strategies, and 2 evidence reports and 22 recent studies reported comparisons of WW versus treatment with curative intent. The most common eligibility criteria for AS were tumor stage (all cohorts), Gleason score (12 cohorts), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration (10 cohorts), and number of biopsy cores positive for cancer (8 cohorts). For monitoring, studies used combinations of periodic PSA testing (all cohorts), digital rectal examination (14 cohorts), and rebiopsy (14 cohorts). Predictors of receiving no active treatment included older age, comorbid conditions, lower Gleason score, tumor stage, PSA concentration, and favorable risk group. No published studies compared AS with immediate treatment with curative intent. Watchful waiting was generally less effective than treatment with curative intent; however, applicability to contemporary patients may be limited.

LIMITATIONS: Active surveillance and WW often could not be differentiated in the reviewed studies. Published randomized trials have assessed only WW and did not enroll patients diagnosed by PSA screening.

CONCLUSION: Evidence is insufficient to assess whether AS is an appropriate option for men with localized prostate cancer. A standard definition of AS that clearly distinguishes it from WW is needed to clarify scientific discourse.

	Abstract = {On soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates with 1D sinusoidal wrinkle patterns, we study the anisotropic wetting behavior and fluidic transport as a function of surface energy and groove geometry. On grooved substrates with a contact angle greater than 90 degrees , liquids form dropletlike morphology, and its contact angle in the direction perpendicular to the grooves is larger than that parallel to the grooves. This wetting anisotropy, for a fixed Young's contact angle, is found to increase when the grooves become deeper. On substrates with a contact angle smaller than 90 degrees and deep grooves (aspect ratio {\textgreater}/=0.3), liquids form filament-like morphology. When the groove depth is further increased by compressing the PDMS film beyond a threshold value, which depends on the surface wettability, fluid starts imbibing the grooves spontaneously. The dynamics of the liquid imbibition of grooves is studied, and a square-law dependence between the length of the liquid filament and time is found, which obeys Washburn's law. Using a simple model based on force balance, we find that the capillary force is mainly responsible for groove filling in sinusoidal grooves.},

Moreover, continuous dynamic perfusion allows the establishment of physiologically relevant drug profiles to exposed spheroids. Here we present a physiologically inspired design allowing microfluidic self-assembly of spheroids, formation of uniform spheroid arrays, and characterizations of spheroid dynamics all in one platform. Our microfluidic device is based on hydrodynamic trapping of cancer cells in controlled geometries and the formation of spheroids is enhanced by maintaining compact groups of the trapped cells due to continuous perfusion. It was found that spheroid formation speed (average of 7 h) and size uniformity increased with increased flow rate (up to 10 microl min(-1)). A large amount of tumor spheroids (7,500 spheroids per square centimeter) with a narrow size distribution (10 +/- 1 cells per spheroid) can be formed in the device to provide a good platform for anticancer drug assays.},

In terms of Taguchi experimental design techniques, an orthogonal array of experiments has been developed which has the least number of experimental runs and desired process parameter settings. Using a 3-D coordinate measuring machine and surface profilometer, a series of measurements in evaluating the SLA parts quality has been conducted to find the functional relationships between the output part quality and input manufacturing process parameters. Two analysis tools, response surface methodology and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), have been used to evaluate the SLA RP process and to perform the product optimization. The optimal setups of SLA manufacturing parameters for both individual features and a general part with various features have been concluded from this study.},

	Abstract = {An important problem in translational cancer research is our limited ability to functionally characterize behaviors of primary patient cancer cells and associated stromal cell types, and relate mechanistic understanding to therapy selection. Functional analyses of primary samples face at least 3 major challenges: limited availability of primary samples for testing, paucity of functional information extracted from samples, and lack of functional methods accessible to many researchers. We developed a microscale cell culture platform that overcomes these limitations, especially for hematologic cancers. A key feature of the platform is the ability to compartmentalize small populations of adherent and nonadherent cells in controlled microenvironments that can better reflect physiological conditions and enable cell-cell interaction studies. Custom image analysis was developed to measure cell viability and protein subcellular localizations in single cells to provide insights into heterogeneity of cellular responses. We validated our platform by assessing viability and nuclear translocations of NF-$\kappa$B and STAT3 in multiple myeloma cells exposed to different conditions, including cocultured bone marrow stromal cells. We further assessed its utility by analyzing NF-$\kappa$B activation in a primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient sample. Our platform can be applied to myriad biological questions, enabling high-content functional cytomics of primary hematologic malignancies.},

	Abstract = {An iron based powder blend has been developed for rapid tooling using a direct laser sintering process. The powder consists of a mixture of different elements including Fe, C, Cu, Mo and Ni. High sintering activities were obtained by tailoring the powder characteristics and optimizing the chemical constituents. The manufacturing of complex-shaped parts is possible at rates of 6.75cm3/h according to CAD data. The residual porosity is less than 5vol.{\%}. The bending strength is around 900MPa and the artifact hardness is 490HV30. To further improve the service life of tools, the processed parts are sintered again in a vacuum furnace at 1260$\,^{\circ}$C for 30min. This enables to manufacture precision parts with the density around 7.7g/cm3 (sintering shrinkage is nearly zero). The dimensional accuracy of the sintered parts is improved by using a beam compensation technique that is integrated in the computer program of the laser sintering system. In this article the sintering behavior, mechanical properties, and microstructural features of the multi-component iron based powder are given and implications of the material for industrial applications are presented. A case study was performed to present the applicability of the material for rapid tooling.},

This knowledge has already expanded treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma. Prototypic drugs thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide have each been approved for the treatment of this disease by targeting both multiple myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment. Although benefit was first shown in relapsed and refractory disease, improved overall response, duration of response, and progression-free and overall survival can be achieved when these drugs are part of first-line regimens. This treatment framework promises to improve outcome not only for patients with multiple myeloma, but also with other haematological malignancies and solid tumours.},

It is therefore imperative to mimic the in vivo tumor niche in vitro to better understand cancer and enhance development of therapeutics. Here, we engineer a 3D metastatic prostate cancer model that includes the types of surrounding cells in the bone microenvironment that the metastatic prostate cancer cells reside in. Specifically, we used a two-layer microfluidic system to culture 3D multi-cell type spheroids of fluorescently labeled metastatic prostate cancer cells (PC-3 cell line), osteoblasts and endothelial cells. This method ensures uniform incorporation of all co-culture cell types into each spheroid and keeps the spheroids stationary for easy tracking of individual spheroids and the PC-3's residing inside them over the course of at least a week. This culture system greatly decreased the proliferation rate of PC-3 cells without reducing viability and may more faithfully recapitulate the in vivo growth behavior of malignant cancer cells within the bone metastatic prostate cancer microenvironment.},

	Abstract = {In vitro culturing of primary multiple myeloma cells (MMC) has been a major challenge as this plasma cell malignancy depends on the bone marrow environment for its survival. Using a microfluidic platform to emulate the dynamic physiology of the bone marrow microenvironment, we report here a new approach for culturing difficult to preserve primary human MMC. The system uses a three-dimensional ossified tissue to mimic the tumor niche and recapitulate interactions between bone marrow cells and osteoblasts (OSB). To this end, the human fetal OSB cell line hFOB 1.19 was cultured in an eight-chamber microfluidic culture device to facilitate the seeding of mononuclear cells from bone marrow aspirates from three multiple myeloma patients. Optical microscopy, used for real-time monitoring of mononuclear cell interactions with the ossified tissue, confirmed that these are drawn toward the OSB layer. After 3 weeks, cocultures were characterized by flow cytometry to evaluate the amount of expansion of primary MMC (with CD138(+) and CD38(+)CD56(+) phenotypes) in this system. For each of the three patients analyzed, bone marrow mononuclear cells underwent, on an average, 2 to 5 expansions; CD38(+)CD56(+) cells underwent 1 to 3 expansions and CD138(+) cells underwent 2.5 to 4.6 expansions. This approach is expected to provide a new avenue that can facilitate: (1) testing of personalized therapeutics for multiple myeloma patients; (2) evaluation of new drugs without the need for costly animal models; and (3) studying the biology of multiple myeloma, and in particular, the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance and relapse.},

	Abstract = {Using stereolithography, 20 different structural variations comprised of millimeter diameter holes surrounded by trenches, plateaus, or micro-ring structures were prepared and tested for their ability to stably hold arrays of microliter sized droplets within the structures over an extended period of time. The micro-ring structures were the most effective in stabilizing droplets against mechanical and chemical perturbations. After confirming the importance of micro-ring structures using rapid prototyping, we developed an injection molding tool for mass production of polystyrene 3D cell culture plates with an array of 384 such micro-ring surrounded through-hole structures. These newly designed and injection molded polystyrene 384 hanging drop array plates with micro-rings were stable and robust against mechanical perturbations as well as surface fouling-facilitated droplet spreading making them capable of long term cell spheroid culture of up to 22 days within the droplet array. This is a significant improvement over previously reported 384 hanging drop array plates which are susceptible to small mechanical shocks and could not reliably maintain hanging drops for longer than a few days. With enhanced droplet stability, the hanging drop array plates with micro-ring structures provide better platforms and open up new opportunities for high-throughput preparation of microscale 3D cell constructs for drug screening and cell analysis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {Single photon burst techniques were used to detect double-stranded DNA molecules in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PM MA) and polycarbonate (PC) microfluidic devices. A confocal epi-illumination detection system was constructed to monitor the fluorescence signature from single DNA molecules that were multiply labeled with the mono-intercalating dye, TOPRO-5, which possessed an absorption maximum at 765 nm allowing excitation with a solid-state diode laser and fluorescence monitoring in the near-infrared (IR). Near-IR excitation minimized autofluorescence produced from the polymer substrate, which was found to be significantly greater when excitation was provided in the visible range (488 nm). A solution containing lambda-DNA (48.5 kbp) was electrokinetically transported through the microfluidic devices at different applied voltages and solution pH values to investigate the effects of polymer substrate on the transport rate and detection efficiency of single molecular events. By applying an autocorrelation analysis to the data, we were able to obtain the molecular transit time of the individual molecules as they passed through the 7 microm laser beam. It was observed that the applied voltage for both devices affected the transport rate. However, solution pH did not alter the transit time for PM MA-based devices since the electroosmotic flow of PMMA was independent of solution pH. In addition, efforts were directed toward optimizing the sampling efficiency (number of molecules passing through the probe volume) by using either hydrodynamically focused flows from a sheath generated by electrokinetic pumping from side channels or reducing the channel width of the microfluidic device. Due to the low electroosmotic flows generated by both PMMA and PC, tight focusing of the sample stream was not possible. However, in PMMA devices, flow gating was observed by applying field strengths {\textgreater} -120 V/cm to the sheath flow channels. By narrowing the microchannel width, the number of molecular events detected per unit time was found to be four times higher in channels with 10 microm widths compared to those of 50 microm, indicating improved sampling efficiency for the narrower channels without significantly deteriorating detection efficiency. Attempts were made to do single molecule sizing of lambda-DNA, M13 (7.2 kbp) and pUC19 (2.7 kbp) using photon burst detection. While the average number of photons for each DNA type were different, the standard deviations were large due to the Gaussian intensity profile of the excitation beam. To demonstrate the sensitivity of single molecule analysis in the near-IR using polymer microfluidic devices, the near-IR chromophore, NN382, wasanalyzed using ourconfocal imager. A detection efficiency of 94{\%} for single NN382 molecules was observed in the PC devices.},

	Abstract = {This work investigates the extent to which parylene can coat the interior of PDMS structures after assembly. Parylene coatings have historically been used as conformal, pinhole-free, gas-impermeable coatings on a wide range of devices. However, this work is the first to systematically characterize how the porous PDMS substrate can affect parylene coating quality. Our work shows that thin coatings of less than 1$\mu$m thickness may contain pinholes, which permit the permeation of gases and solvents into the surrounding bulk PDMS structure. The penetration of parylene into PDMS matrix that occurs during deposition was measured using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). The thickness uniformity and penetration depth of vapor-deposited parylene C coatings into narrow PDMS channels was measured using profilometry and correlated with an analytical model. The coating along the length of a microchannel is not homogeneous. The parylene film thickness decreases with increasing distance from the channel access holes. Parylene coatings greater than 1$\mu$m form an airtight seal, and air bubbles trapped in dead end channels do not escape through this wall. Fluorescence of rhodamine diffusing beyond the coating barrier in a channel was used to confirm the parylene penetration distance, as well as determine the position at which pinholes appear in the coating. We identify a characteristic length scale which allows us to calculate a dimensionless penetration length for a given set of deposition parameters. This result is applicable to other geometries, to enable optimal design of structures which require this coating.},

These interactions can be studied using microfluidic systems that operate in the "open space", that is, without the need for the sealed channels and chambers commonly used in microfluidics. This emerging class of techniques localizes chemical reactions on biological interfaces or specimens without imposing significant "constraints" on samples, such as encapsulation, pre-processing steps, or the need for scaffolds. They therefore provide new opportunities for handling, analyzing, and interacting with biological samples. The motivation for performing localized chemistry is discussed, as are the requirements imposed on localization techniques. Three classes of microfluidic systems operating in the open space, based on microelectrochemistry, multiphase transport, and hydrodynamic flow confinement of liquids are presented.},

@article{Bharti2003,
	Abstract = {Numerous reports suggest that IL-6 promotes survival and proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells through the phosphorylation of a cell signaling protein, STAT3. Thus, agents that suppress STAT3 phosphorylation have potential for the treatment of MM. In the present report, we demonstrate that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a pharmacologically safe agent in humans, inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and consequent STAT3 nuclear translocation. Curcumin had no effect on STAT5 phosphorylation, but inhibited the IFN-alpha-induced STAT1 phosphorylation. The constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 found in certain MM cells was also abrogated by treatment with curcumin. Curcumin-induced inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation was reversible. Compared with AG490, a well-characterized Janus kinase 2 inhibitor, curcumin was a more rapid (30 min vs 8 h) and more potent (10 micro M vs 100 micro M) inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation. In a similar manner, the dose of curcumin completely suppressed proliferation of MM cells; the same dose of AG490 had no effect. In contrast, a cell-permeable STAT3 inhibitor peptide that can inhibit the STAT3 phosphorylation mediated by Src blocked the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 and also suppressed the growth of myeloma cells. TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin also induced the proliferation of MM cells, but through a mechanism independent of STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, dexamethasone-resistant MM cells were found to be sensitive to curcumin. Overall, our results demonstrated that curcumin was a potent inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation, and this plays a role in the suppression of MM proliferation.},

	Abstract = {Elevated expression of receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM) within ex vivo diagnostic multiple myeloma plasma cells predicts for aggressive disease and patient survival. Here, we investigate the relationship between RHAMM and centrosomal abnormalities within multiple myeloma patient samples. We report that myeloma patient samples contain pervasive structural and numerical centrosomal abnormalities. Structural, but not numerical, centrosomal abnormalities strongly correlate with elevated RHAMM expression. As others have shown that excess pericentriolar material strongly associates with abnormal mitoses, we modeled centrosomal abnormalities with exogenous RHAMM overexpression. RHAMM overexpression in vitro resulted in centrosomal and mitotic defects. To elucidate a mechanism for RHAMM-mediated spindle defects, we further investigated RHAMM mitotic function. RHAMM mitotic localization mirrors that of targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2), and RHAMM interacts with the spindle assembly factors dynein and TPX2. Like TPX2, RHAMM expression is up-regulated during mitosis. Moreover, inhibition of function experiments reveals that RHAMM and TPX2 functions converge to maintain spindle integrity after spindle assembly. We postulate that augmentation of RHAMM expression within human cancers, including myeloma, can directly affect centrosomal structure and spindle integrity and potentially modulate apoptotic and cell cycle progression pathways.},

Detailed analyses of fluid mechanics in atherosclerosis-susceptible regions of the vasculature reveal a strong correlation between endothelial cell dysfunction and areas of low mean shear stress and oscillatory flow with flow recirculation. Conversely, steady shear stress stimulates cellular responses that are essential for endothelial cell function and are atheroprotective. The molecular basis of shear-induced mechanochemical signal transduction and the endothelium's ability to discriminate between flow profiles remains largely unclear. Given that fluid shear stress does not involve a traditional receptor/ligand interaction, identification of the molecule(s) responsible for sensing fluid flow and mechanical force discrimination has been difficult. This review will provide an overview of the haemodynamic forces experienced by the vascular endothelium and its role in localizing atherosclerotic lesions within specific regions of the vasculature. Also reviewed are several recent lines of evidence suggesting that both changes in membrane microviscosity linked to heterotrimeric G proteins, and the transmission of tension across the cell membrane to the cell-cell junction where known shear-sensitive proteins are localized, may serve as the primary force-sensing elements of the cell.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular matrix is a key regulator of normal homeostasis and tissue phenotype. Important signals are lost when cells are cultured ex vivo on two-dimensional plastic substrata. Many of these crucial microenvironmental cues may be restored using three-dimensional (3D) cultures of laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM). These 3D culture assays allow phenotypic discrimination between nonmalignant and malignant mammary cells, as the former grown in a 3D context form polarized, growth-arrested acinus-like colonies whereas the latter form disorganized, proliferative and nonpolar colonies. Signaling pathways that function in parallel in cells cultured on plastic become reciprocally integrated when the cells are exposed to basement membrane-like gels. Appropriate 3D culture thus provides a more physiologically relevant approach to the analysis of gene function and cell phenotype ex vivo. We describe here a robust and generalized method for the culturing of various human breast cell lines in three dimensions and describe the preparation of cellular extracts from these cultures for molecular analyses. The procedure below describes the 3D 'embedded' assay, in which cells are cultured embedded in an lrECM gel (Fig. 1). By lrECM, we refer to the solubilized extract derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells. For a discussion of user options regarding 3D matrices, see Box 1. Alternatively, the 3D 'on-top' assay, in which cells are cultured on top of a thin lrECM gel overlaid with a dilute solution of lrECM, may be used as described in Box 2 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).},

	Abstract = {Microfluidics has emerged as a valuable tool for the high-resolution patterning of biological probes on solid supports. Yet, its widespread adoption as a universal biological immobilization tool is still limited by several technical challenges, particularly for the patterning of isolated spots using three-dimensional (3D) channel networks. A key limitation arises from the difficulties to adapt the techniques and materials typically used in prototyping to low-cost mass-production. In this paper, we present the fabrication of thin thermoplastic elastomer membranes with microscopic through-holes using a hot-embossing process that is compatible with high-throughput manufacturing. The membranes provide the basis for the fabrication of highly integrated 3D microfluidic devices with a footprint of only 1 × 1 cm(2). When placed on a solid support, the device allows for the immobilization of up to 96 different probes in the form of a 10 × 10 array comprising isolated spots of 50 × 50 $\mu$m(2). The design of the channel network is optimized using 3D simulations based on the Lattice-Boltzmann method to promote capillary action as the sole force distributing the liquid in the device. Finally, we demonstrate the patterning of DNA and protein arrays on hard thermoplastic substrates yielding spots of excellent definition that prove to be highly specific in subsequent hybridization experiments.},

	Abstract = {Osteoclasts play a key role in the development of cancer-associated osteolytic lesions. The number and activity of osteoclasts are often enhanced by tumors. However, the origin of osteoclasts is unknown. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are one of the pre-metastatic niche components that are induced to expand by tumor cells. Here we show that the MDSCs can differentiate into mature and functional osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. Inoculation of 5TGM1-GFP myeloma cells into C57BL6/KaLwRij mice led to a significant expansion of MDSCs in blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. When grown in osteoclastogenic media in vitro, MDSCs from tumor-challenged mice displayed 14 times greater potential to differentiate into mature and functional osteoclasts than those from non-tumor controls. Importantly, MDSCs from tumor-challenged LacZ transgenic mice differentiated into LacZ+osteoclasts in vivo. Furthermore, a significant increase in tumor burden and bone loss accompanied by increased number of osteoclasts was observed in mice co-inoculated with tumor-challenged MDSCs and 5TGM1 cells compared to the control animals received 5TGM1 cells alone. Finally, treatment of MDSCs from myeloma-challenged mice with Zoledronic acid (ZA), a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, inhibited the number of osteoclasts formed in MDSC cultures and the expansion of MDSCs and bone lesions in mice. Collectively, these data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that tumor-induced MDSCs exacerbate cancer-associated bone destruction by directly serving as osteoclast precursors.},

	Abstract = {Methods were studied for the preparation, isolation, and growth of single cells into cultures. The first step was to secure actively growing cells. Marigold tissue of crown gall origin grew well in liquid on a shaker when the initial pH was from 4.6 to 7.0. Tissues of several species grew well in liquid under several aeration conditions. The growth rates of liquid marigold cultures on a shaker were increased by up to 0.02 per cent yeast extract and were inhibited above 0.04 per cent. Single cells were isolated from diffuse liquid cultures and friable agar cultures. Attempts to grow single cells on agar media, on filter paper over agar media, or in sealed hanging drops of "acclimated" medium generally were unsuccessful. Single cells grew successfully on filter paper over established cultures. Most cultures of single cell origin (clones) grew well after transfer to agar, but some did not. Several were carried through 25 or more agar transfers, each of 5 to 6 weeks duration, without diminution in growth. Clones were established from single cells of marigold and grape of crown gall origin and from normal N. tabacum (strain WTI), N. glutinosa x N. tabacum (strain WTH), and marigold. Constant differences were observed among clones derived from the same parent stock of marigold (crown gall origin) in growth rate, texture, and color. Some clones with varied media have developed shoots or roots in culture. CR  - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1958 Botanical Society of America},

	Abstract = {The effect of surface roughness on osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and protein synthesis was examined. Human osteoblast-like cells (MG63) were cultured on titanium (Ti) disks that had been prepared by one of five different treatment regimens. All disks were pretreated with hydrofluroic acid-nitric acid and washed (PT). PT disks were also: washed, and then electropolished (EP); fine sandblasted, etched with HCl and H2SO4, and washed (FA); coarse sandblasted, etched with HCl and H2SO4, and washed (CA); or Ti plasma-sprayed (TPS). Standard tissue culture plastic was used as a control. Surface topography and profile were evaluated by brightfield and darkfield microscopy, cold field emission scanning electron microscopy, and laser confocal microscopy, while chemical composition was mapped using energy dispersion X-ray analysis and elemental distribution determined using Auger electron spectroscopy. The effect of surface roughness on the cells was evaluated by measuring cell number, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, alkaline phosphatase specific activity, [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA, [3H]proline incorporation into collagenase digestible protein (CDP) and noncollagenase-digestible protein (NCP), and [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan. Based on surface analysis, the five different Ti surfaces were ranked in order of smoothest to roughest: EP, PT, FA, CA, and TPS. A TiO2 layer was found on all surfaces that ranged in thickness from 100 A in the smoothest group to 300 A in the roughest. When compared to confluent cultures of cells on plastic, the number of cells was reduced on the TPS surfaces and increased on the EP surfaces, while the number of cells on the other surfaces was equivalent to plastic. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was inversely related to surface roughness. Alkaline phosphatase specific activity in isolated cells was found to decrease with increasing surface roughness, except for those cells cultured on CA. In contrast, enzyme activity in the cell layer was only decreased in cultures grown on FA- and TPS-treated surfaces. A direct correlation between surface roughness and RNA and CDP production was found. Surface roughness had no apparent effect on NCP production. Proteoglycan synthesis by the cells was inhibited on all the surfaces studied, with the largest inhibition observed in the CA and EP groups. These results demonstrate that surface roughness alters osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production in vitro. The results also suggest that implant surface roughness may play a role in determining phenotypic expression of cells in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Fibronectins isolated fro early-passage and late-passage (in vitro aged) human fibroblasts were shown to differ in their ability to support cell adhesion and to influence cell morphology. Because fibroblast adhesion requires interactions between fibronectin, the cell surface, and the component of the extracellular matrix, we examined those functions in isolated cellular fibronectin. In comparison to fibronectin isolated from early-passage cells, fibronectin from late-passage cells bound poorly to native collagen types I and II. No differences were observed in the binding of the two fibronectins to denatured collagen. The binding of both fibronectins to native collagen was similarly promoted by heparin. Cell binding activity was evaluated by using a Boyden chamber assay to measure chemotaxis in response to either fibronectin. No differences were detected in cell binding. Comparisons of molecular weights by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that fibronectin from late-passage cells is larger than that from early-passage cells. That difference is observed both in fibronectins isolated from conditioned media and in fibronectins isolated from the cell layer. These data support the hypothesis that late-passage cells produce a structurally and functionally distinct fibronectin. The defective binding to native collagen may account for some aspects of the aged phenotype.},

	Abstract = {In the era of new and mostly effective therapeutic protocols, multiple myeloma still tends to be a hard-to-treat hematologic cancer. This hallmark of the disease is in fact a sequel to drug resistant phenotypes persisting initially or emerging in the course of treatment. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of multiple myeloma makes treating patients with the same drug challenging because finding a drugable oncogenic process common to all patients is not yet feasible, while our current knowledge of genetic/epigenetic basis of multiple myeloma pathogenesis is outstanding. Nonetheless, bone marrow microenvironment components are well known as playing critical roles in myeloma tumor cell survival and environment-mediated drug resistance happening most possibly in all myeloma patients. Generally speaking, however; real mechanisms underlying drug resistance in multiple myeloma are not completely understood. The present review will discuss the latest findings and concepts in this regard. It reviews the association of important chromosomal translocations, oncogenes (e.g. TP53) mutations and deranged signaling pathways (e.g. NF$\kappa$B) with drug response in clinical and experimental investigations. It will also highlight how bone marrow microenvironment signals (Wnt, Notch) and myeloma cancer stem cells could contribute to drug resistance in multiple myeloma.},

	Abstract = {Although there is effective chemotherapy for many patients with leukemia, 20{\%} of children and up to 65{\%} of adults relapse. Novel therapies are needed to treat these patients. Leukemia cells are very sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (VELCADE(R), PS-341), which enhances the in vitro cytotoxic effects of dexamethasone and doxorubicin in multiple myeloma. To determine if bortezomib enhances the cytotoxicity of agents used in leukemia, we employed an in vitro tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT) to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of bortezomib alone and in combination with dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, cytarabine, asparaginase, geldanamycin, trichostatin A, and the bcl-2 inhibitor HA14.1. We demonstrated that primary leukemia lymphoblasts and leukemia cell lines are sensitive to bortezomib, with an average IC(50) of 12 nM. Qualitative and quantitative bortezomib-drug interactions were evaluated using the universal response surface approach (URSA). Bortezomib was synergistic with dexamethasone in dexamethasone-sensitive leukemia cells, and additive with vincristine, asparaginase, cytarabine, and doxorubicin. The anti-leukemic activity of bortezomib was also additive with geldanamycin and HA14.1, and additive or synergistic with trichostatin A. These results were compared to analysis using the median-dose effect method, which generated complex drug interactions due to differences in dose-response curve sigmoidicities. These data suggest bortezomib could potentiate the cytotoxic effects of combination chemotherapy in patients with leukemia.},

	Abstract = {Neutrophils need to correctly interpret gradients of chemotactic factors (CFs) such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) to migrate to the site of infection and perform immune functions. Because diffusion-based chemotaxis assays used in previous studies suffer from temporally changing gradients, it is difficult to distinguish the influence of CF gradient steepness from mean CF concentration on chemotaxis. To better understand the roles of mean CF concentration and CF gradient steepness, we developed a microfluidic device that can maintain stable IL-8 gradients. We report that the random motility of neutrophils is a biphasic function of IL-8 concentration and its magnitude plays a decisive role in effective chemotaxis, a quantitative measure of migration. We show that the concentrations for the optimum chemotaxis in linear IL-8 gradients and for the maximum random motility in uniform IL-8 coincide. In contrast, we find that the steepness of IL-8 gradients has no significant effect on effective chemotaxis.},

	Abstract = {Clonal proliferation of plasma cells within the bone marrow (BM) affects local cells, such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), leading to osteolysis and fatality in multiple myeloma (MM). Consequently, there is an urgent need to find better mechanisms of inhibiting myeloma growth and osteolytic lesion development. To meet this need and accelerate clinical translation, better models of myeloma within the BM are required. Herein we have developed a clinically relevant, three-dimensional (3D) myeloma BM coculture model that mimics bone cell/cancer cell interactions within the bone microenvironment. The coculture model and clinical samples were used to investigate myeloma growth, osteogenesis inhibition, and myeloma-induced abnormalities in MM-MSCs. This platform demonstrated myeloma support of capillarylike assembly of endothelial cells and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Also, distinct normal donor (ND)- and MM-MSC miRNA (miR) signatures were identified and used to uncover osteogenic miRs of interest for osteoblast differentiation. More broadly, our 3D platform provides a simple, clinically relevant tool to model cancer growth within the bone-useful for investigating skeletal cancer biology, screening compounds, and exploring osteogenesis. Our identification and efficacy validation of novel bone anabolic miRs in MM opens more opportunities for novel approaches to cancer therapy via stromal miR modulation.},

Decades of scientific research are now beginning to unravel the intricate biology that underlies the pathophysiology of MM. In particular, the roles of cellular differentiation, molecular pathogenesis, and oncogenes involved in the natural history of MM are becoming clearer. This has enabled the identification of specific cytokines, adhesion molecules, and stromal cells that affect MM cell development, disease progression, and treatment responses. This review describes our current understanding regarding the biology of MM, and how this has led to a robust pipeline of novel therapeutic agents with the potential to overcome resistance to existing MM therapies and, therefore, further improve outcomes in patients with MM.},

Such 3D culture models, however, are often more complicated, cumbersome, and expensive than two-dimensional (2D) cultures. This paper describes a 384-well format hanging drop culture plate that makes spheroid formation, culture, and subsequent drug testing on the obtained 3D cellular constructs as straightforward to perform and adapt to existing high-throughput screening (HTS) instruments as conventional 2D cultures. Using this platform, we show that drugs with different modes of action produce distinct responses in the physiological 3D cell spheroids compared to conventional 2D cell monolayers. Specifically, the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has higher anti-proliferative effects on 2D cultures whereas the hypoxia activated drug commonly referred to as tirapazamine (TPZ) are more effective against 3D cultures. The multiplexed 3D hanging drop culture and testing plate provides an efficient way to obtain biological insights that are often lost in 2D platforms.},

	Abstract = {The study of angiogenesis is important to understanding a variety of human pathologies including cancer, cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In vivo angiogenesis assays can be costly and time-consuming, limiting their application in high-throughput studies. While traditional in vitro assays may overcome these limitations, they lack the ability to accurately recapitulate the main elements of the tissue microenvironment found in vivo, thereby limiting our ability to draw physiologically relevant biological conclusions. To bridge the gap between in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis assays, several microfluidic methods have been developed to generate in vitro assays that incorporate blood vessel models with physiologically relevant three-dimensional (3D) lumen structures. However, these models have not seen widespread adoption, which can be partially attributed to the difficulty in fabricating these structures. Here, we present a simple, accessible method that takes advantage of basic fluidic principles to create 3D lumens with circular cross-sectional geometries through ECM hydrogels that are lined with endothelial monolayers to mimic the structure of blood vessels in vitro. This technique can be used to pattern endothelial cell-lined lumens in different microchannel geometries, enabling increased flexibility for a variety of studies. We demonstrate the implementation and application of this technique to the study of angiogenesis in a physiologically relevant in vitro setting.},

	Abstract = {Laminar flow patterning (LFP) is a characteristic method of microfluidic systems that allows two (or more) different solutions to flow side-by-side in a channel without convective mixing. This fluid behavior can be used to pattern cell suspensions, particles, and treatments as well as to create chemical gradients. LFP is typically implemented using syringe pumps and, for this reason, is most effective in constant flow scenarios such as long-term gradient generation. However, the complexity of using syringe pumps for patterning cell suspensions typically makes it a less attractive option than other standard patterning methods. We present a passive microfluidic method that enables short-term LFP of multiple fluids using a single pipette and allows each sample to be loaded in any sequence, at any point in time relative to one another. The proposed method is well-suited for cell-based assays, reduces the complexity of LFP to be on a similar level as other cell patterning methods, can be scaled to include more than two streams of fluid, and enables arrays of individually addressable devices for LFP on a single chip.},

@article{Beck1997,
	Abstract = {Although various techniques exust for high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging of trabecular bone, a common limitation is that resolution depends on specimen size. Most techniques also have limited availability due to their expense and complexity. We therefore developed a simple, accurate technique that has a resolution that is independent of specimen size. Thin layers are serially removed from an embedded bone specimen using a computer numerically controlled (CNC) milling machine, and each exposed cross section is imaged using a low-magnification digital camera. Precise positioning of the specimen under the camera is achieved using the programmable feature of the CNC milling machine. Large specimens are imaged without loss of resolution by moving the specimen under the camera such that an array of field-of-views spans the full cross section. The images from each field-of-view are easily assembled and registered in the postprocessing. High-contrast sections are achieved by staining the bone black with silver nitrate and embedding it in whitened methylmethacrylate. Due to the high contrast nature and high resolution of the images, thresholding at a single value yielded excellent predictions of morphological parameters such as bone volume fraction (mean $\pm$ SD percent error = 0.70 $\pm$ 4.28{\%}). The main limitations of this fully automated ``CNC milling technique'' are that the specimen is destroyed and the process is relatively slow. However, because of its accuracy, independence of image resolution from specimen size, and ease of implementation, this new technique is an excellent method for ex situ imaging of trabecular architecture, particularly when high resolution is required.},

@article{Regehr2009,
	Abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has become a staple of the microfluidics community by virtue of its simple fabrication process and material attributes, such as gas permeability, optical transparency, and flexibility. As microfluidic systems are put toward biological problems and increasingly utilized as cell culture platforms, the material properties of PDMS must be considered in a biological context. Two properties of PDMS were addressed in this study: the leaching of uncured oligomers from the polymer network into microchannel media, and the absorption of small, hydrophobic molecules (i.e. estrogen) from serum-containing media into the polymer bulk. Uncured PDMS oligomers were detectable via MALDI-MS in microchannel media both before and after Soxhlet extraction of PDMS devices in ethanol. Additionally, PDMS oligomers were identified in the plasma membranes of NMuMG cells cultured in PDMS microchannels for 24 hours. Cells cultured in extracted microchannels also contained a detectable amount of uncured PDMS. It was shown that MCF-7 cells seeded directly on PDMS inserts were responsive to hydrophilic prolactin but not hydrophobic estrogen, reflecting its specificity for absorbing small, hydrophobic molecules; and the presence of PDMS floating in wells significantly reduced cellular response to estrogen in a serum-dependent manner. Quantification of estrogen via ELISA revealed that microchannel estrogen partitioned rapidly into the surrounding PDMS to a ratio of approximately 9:1. Pretreatments such as blocking with serum or pre-absorbing estrogen for 24 hours did not affect estrogen loss from PDMS-based microchannels. These findings highlight the importance of careful consideration of culture system properties when determining an appropriate environment for biological experiments.},

@article{Mishima2013,
	Abstract = {Introduction Recent evidence indicates that tumor cells are not only influenced by their microenvironment, but are also able to drastically alter their surroundings leading to cancer progression. Multiple Myeloma (MM) involves clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow, inhibition of osteoblast function, and increased osteoclast activity leading to osteolytic lesions. Our work aims to understand the bi-directional interactions between MM cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), using both 2D and 3D in vitro co-culture bone marrow models.

Methods We developed a 3D in vitro model system to better mimic myeloma growth within the bone marrow using human MSCs (hMSCs) and fluorescent-, luciferase-labeled MM cell lines seeded into porous, autofluorescent silk scaffolds. Proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of myeloma patient (MM-) and normal donor (ND-) MSCs cultured with or without MM.1S cells were characterized in 2D culture and 3D scaffolds. Non-destructive bioluminescent imaging and fluorescent confocal imaging were used to observe cell growth and cell-cell interactions within scaffolds. Histology was performed to confirm changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) production and bone tissue formation.

microRNA (miRNA) profiling was performed on primary ND- (n=3) and MM-MSCs (n=7) using Nanostring technologies. We analyzed 800 human miRNAs from miRBase v.18 and 230 human cancer-related genes using the nCounter{\textregistered} Human Cancer Reference Kit. Gain-of function studies (miRvana mimics) were performed for miRNAs that were down-modulated in MM vs ND-MSCs, and in the 3D model MSCs co-cultured with MM.1S vs MSCs alone, using lipofectamine. Modulation of osteogenesis was evaluated using alizarin red staining and qRT-PCR for the osteogenic markers: IBSP (integrin-binding sialoprotein), Col1a1 (collagen, type I, alpha 1), RUNX2 (runt related transcription factor 2), ALPL (alkaline phosphatase), OPN (secreted phosphoprotein 1), and BGLAP (bone gamma-carboxyglutamate (gla) protein).

Results MM -MSCs presented with a lower proliferation rate compared to ND-MSCs and this phenotype was also observed in ND-MSCs co-cultured in the presence of MM.1S cells compared to ND-MSCs alone. Moreover, significant inhibition of MSC growth was evident when co-cultured with MM.1S cells, using a 3D model ([Figure 1][1]), where inhibition of osteogenesis, and ECM production were also documented. Alizarin red staining demonstrated inhibited ability for MM-MSCs to undergo osteogenic differentiation. In addition, MM-MSCs differed from ND-MSCs at the gene and miRNA level. Specifically, CDKN1A and CDKN2A were over-expressed in MM vs. ND-MSCs, (P{\textless}0.05; fold change {\textgreater}1.2), thus explaining, at least in part, the decreased proliferation of MM-MSCs vs ND-MSCs. Moreover, down-regulation of specific miRNAs (miRNA-199a, -24-3p, -199a, -15a-5p, -16-5p) was demonstrated in MM- vs ND-MSCs, as well as in ND-MSCs vs ND-MSCs co-cultured with MM.1S, using the 3D model. By over-expressing miRNA-199a, -15a-5p and -16-5p, we were able to increase the osteogenic potential, thus suggesting their role in modulating osteogenesis in MM-MSCs.

![Figure][2]{\textless}/img{\textgreater}

Conclusions Our 3D platform provides a simple, non-destructive, flexible, and clinically relevant tool to spatially and temporally model myeloma growth within bone. It recapitulates decreased bone formation as seen in MM patients and suggests miR-199a-3p, 15a-5p and 16-5p as novel bone anabolic targets.

	Abstract = {The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri uses multiple secreted effector proteins to downregulate interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in infected epithelial cells. Yet, massive IL-8 secretion is observed in Shigellosis. Here we report a host mechanism of cell-cell communication that circumvents the effector proteins and strongly amplifies IL-8 expression during bacterial infection. By monitoring proinflammatory signals at the single-cell level, we found that the activation of the transcription factor NF-$\kappa$B and the MAP kinases JNK, ERK, and p38 rapidly propagated from infected to uninfected adjacent cells, leading to IL-8 production by uninfected bystander cells. Bystander IL-8 production was also observed during Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium infection. This response could be triggered by recognition of peptidoglycan and is mediated by gap junctions. Thus, we have identified a mechanism of cell-cell communication that amplifies innate immunity against bacterial infection by rapidly spreading proinflammatory signals via gap junctions to yet uninfected cells.},

The coverslips were dehydrated in ethanol, critical point dried with CO2, and coated with gold-palladium. With the aid of a locator grid, several fields were photographed with light microscopy after the cells had settled onto the poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and again after completion of the processing before SEM observation. Quantitative comparison of the number of cells present after settling with the number retained for final viewing with the SEM revealed a cell yield approaching 100{\%}. This simple, reproducible, high-yield technique for processing cells fixed in suspension for SEM prevents changes in surface architecture induced by collecting live cells onto various substrates before fixation and also avoids potentially selective cell losses. Such a technique should allow quantitative correlations between SEM and other morphological and functional parameters.},

Here we show that the clonal immunoglobulin in patients with Gaucher's disease and in mouse models of Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathy is reactive against lyso-glucosylceramide (LGL1), which is markedly elevated in these patients and mice. Clonal immunoglobulin in 33{\%} of sporadic human monoclonal gammopathies is also specific for the lysolipids LGL1 and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Substrate reduction ameliorates Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathy in mice. Thus, long-term immune activation by lysolipids may underlie both Gaucher's disease-associated gammopathies and some sporadic monoclonal gammopathies.},

@article{Chiu2012,
	Abstract = {Research in the last few years have focused on the use of three-dimensional (3D) fibrin construct to deliver growth factors and cells. Three-dimensional construct permeability and porosity are important aspects for proper nutrient uptake, gas exchange, and waste removal-factors that are critical for cell growth and survival. We have previously reported that the mechanical strength (stiffness) of 3D fibrin constructs is dependent on the fibrinogen and thrombin concentration. In this study, we established two new in vitro models to examine how fibrin composition affects the final 3D fibrin construct permeability and pore size; thereby, influencing the diffusivity of macromolecules throughout the network of fibrin fibrils. Flow measurements of both liquid and fluoresceinated-dextran microparticles are conducted to calculate the permeability and pore size of 3D fibrin constructs of different fibrinogen and thrombin concentrations. Similarly, the diffusivity of liquid and fluoresceinated-dextran microparticles through these 3D fibrin constructs are determined through diffusion models. Data from these studies show that the structural permeability and pore size of 3D fibrin constructs directly correlate to fibrinogen and thrombin concentration in the final 3D fibrin construct. More specifically, at a constant thrombin concentration of 2 or 5 $\mu$/mL, pore size of the 3D fibrin constructs is dependent on fibrinogen if the concentration is 5 mg/mL and to a lesser extent if the concentration is 10-15 mg/mL. These findings suggest that fibrin's diffusive property can be manipulated to fabricate 3D constructs that are optimized for cellular growth, protein transport, and for the controlled delivery of bioactive molecules such as growth factors.},

However, both intrinsic and acquired resistance has already been observed. In this study, we explored the relationship between CD9 expression and bortezomib sensitivity in MM. We found that down-regulation of CD9 by methylation decreased bortezomib sensitivity in multiple myeloma. CD9 expression obviously increased bortezomib sensitivity through inducing apoptosis, significantly inhibiting U266 cells' adhesion to HS-5 and primary bone marrow stromal cells, but increasing U266 cells' adhesion to fibronectin. CD9 expression also significantly inhibited U266 cell migration. The mechanisms may include: the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, cell adhesion related signaling pathway and osteoclast differentiation related signaling pathway. Combination therapy with de-methylation reagent 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine may prove useful to the development of novel strategies for the treatment of bortezomib-resistant MM patients.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have underscored the role of B-cell-activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, in promoting the survival of malignant B cells, including human multiple myeloma. We here characterized the functional significance of BAFF in the interaction between multiple myeloma and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and further defined the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes. BAFF is detected on BMSCs derived from multiple myeloma patients as evidenced by flow cytometry. BAFF secretion is 3- to 10-fold higher in BMSCs than in multiple myeloma cells, and tumor cell adhesion to BMSCs augments BAFF secretion by 2- to 5-fold, confirmed by both ELISA and immunoblotting. Adhesion of MM1S and MCCAR multiple myeloma cell lines to KM104 BMSC line transfected with a luciferase reporter vector carrying the BAFF gene promoter (BAFF-LUC) significantly enhanced luciferase activity, suggesting that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation induced by multiple myeloma adhesion to BMSCs mediates BAFF up-regulation. Moreover, BAFF (0-100 ng/mL) increases adhesion of multiple myeloma lines to BMSCs in a dose-dependent manner; conversely, transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophylin ligand interactor-Ig or B-cell maturation antigen/Fc blocked BAFF stimulation. Using adenoviruses expressing dominant-negative and constitutively expressed AKT as well as NF-kappaB inhibitors, we further showed that BAFF-induced multiple myeloma cell adhesion is primarily mediated via activation of AKT and NF-kappaB signaling. Importantly, BAFF similarly increased adhesion of CD138-expressing patient multiple myeloma cells to BMSCs. These studies establish a role for BAFF in localization and survival of multiple myeloma cells in the bone marrow microenvironment and strongly support novel therapeutics, targeting the interaction between BAFF and its receptors in human multiple myeloma.},

	Abstract = {The microenvironment has been shown to influence tumor cell phenotype with respect to growth, metastasis, and response to chemotherapy. We have utilized oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify signal transduction pathways and gene products altered by the interaction of myeloma tumor cells with the extracellular matrix component fibronectin that may contribute to the antiapoptotic phenotype conferred by the microenvironment. Genes with altered expression associated with fibronectin cell adhesion, either induced or repressed, were numerically ranked by fold change. FN adhesion repressed the expression of 469 gene products, while 53 genes with known coding sequences were induced by twofold or more. Of these 53 genes with two fold, or greater increase in expression, 11 have been reported to be regulated by the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) family of transcription factors. EMSA analysis demonstrated NF-kappa B binding activity significantly increased in cells adhered to fibronectin compared to cells in suspension. This DNA binding activity consisted primarily of RelB-p50 heterodimers, which was distinct from the NF-kappa B activation of TNF alpha. These data demonstrate the selectivity of signal transduction from the microenvironment that may contribute to tumor cell resistance to programmed cell death.},

@article{Chuderland2008,
	Abstract = {Upon stimulation, many proteins translocate into the nucleus in order to regulate a variety of cellular processes. The mechanism underlying the translocation is not clear since many of these proteins lack a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS). We searched for an alternative mechanism in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-2 and identified a 3 amino acid domain (SPS) that is phosphorylated upon stimulation to induce nuclear translocation of ERK2. A 19 amino acid stretch containing this phosphorylated domain inserts nondiffusible proteins to the nucleus autonomously. The phosphorylated SPS acts by binding to importin7 and the release from nuclear pore proteins. This allows its functioning both in passive and active ERK transports. A similar domain appears in many cytonuclear shuttling proteins, and we found that phosphorylation of similar sequences in SMAD3 or MEK1 also induces their nuclear accumulation. Therefore, our findings show that this phosphorylated domain acts as a general nuclear translocation signal (NTS).},

	Abstract = {The purification of analytes is an important prerequisite for many analytical processes. Although automated infrastructure has dramatically increased throughput for many of these processes, the upstream analyte purification throughput has lagged behind, partially due to the complexity of conventional isolation processes. Here, we demonstrate automated operation of arrays of a new sample preparation technology--immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (IFAST). IFAST uses surface tension to position an immiscible liquid barrier between a biological sample and downstream buffer. Paramagnetic particles are used to capture analytes of interest and draw them across the immiscible barrier, thus resulting in purification in a single step. Furthermore, the planarity of the IFAST design enables facile and simultaneous operation of multiple IFAST devices. To demonstrate the application of automation to IFAST, we successfully perform an array of 48 IFAST-based assays to detect the presence of a specific antibody. This assay array uses only a commercial automated liquid handler to load the devices and a custom-built magnet actuator to operate the assays. Automated operation of the IFAST devices resulted in more repeatable results relative to manual operation.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we introduce a simple solvent-assisted micromolding technique for the fabrication of high-fidelity styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) microfluidic devices with high polystyrene (PS) content (42 wt{\%} PS, SEBS42). SEBS triblock copolymers are styrenic thermoplastic elastomers that exhibit both glassy thermoplastic and elastomeric properties resulting from their respective hard PS and rubbery ethylene/butylene segments. The PS fraction gives SEBS microdevices many of the appealing properties of pure PS devices, while the elastomeric properties simplify fabrication of the devices, similar to PDMS. SEBS42 devices have wettable, stable surfaces (both contact angle and zeta potential) that support cell attachment and proliferation consistent with tissue culture dish substrates, do not adsorb hydrophobic molecules, and have high bond strength to wide range of substrates (glass, PS, SEBS). Furthermore, SEBS42 devices are mechanically robust, thermally stable, as well as exhibit low auto-fluorescence and high transmissivity. We characterize SEBS42 surface properties by contact angle measurements, cell culture studies, zeta potential measurements, and the adsorption of hydrophobic molecules. The PS surface composition of SEBS microdevices cast on different substrates is determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The attractive SEBS42 material properties, coupled with the simple fabrication method, make SEBS42 a quality substrate for microfluidic applications where the properties of PS are desired but the ease of PDMS micromolding is favoured.},

@article{Berthier2012,
	Abstract = {As the integration of microfluidics into cell biology research proceeds at an ever-increasing pace, a critical question for those working at the interface of both disciplines is which device material to use for a given application. While PDMS and soft lithography methods offer the engineer rapid prototyping capabilities, PDMS as a material has characteristics that have known adverse effects on cell-based experiments. In contrast, while polystyrene (PS), the most commonly used thermoplastic for laboratory cultureware, has provided decades of grounded and validated research conclusions in cell behavior and function, PS as a material has posed significant challenges in microfabrication. These competing issues have forced microfluidics engineers and biologists to make compromises in how they approach specific research questions, and furthermore, have attenuated the impact of microfluidics on biological research. In this review, we provide a comparison of the attributes of PDMS and PS, and discuss reasons for their popularity in their respective fields. We provide a critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of PDMS and PS in relation to the advancement and future impact on microfluidic cell-based studies and applications. We believe that engineers have a responsibility to overcome any challenges associated with microfabrication, whether with PS or other materials, and that engineers should provide options and solutions that assist biologists in their experimental design. Our goal is not to advocate for any specific material, but provide guidelines for researchers who desire to choose the most suitable material for their application, and suggest important research directions for engineers working at the interface between microfabrication technology and biological application.},

@article{Hideshima2002,
	Abstract = {We have shown that thalidomide (Thal) and its immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitor PS-341, and As(2)O(3) act directly on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and in the bone marrow (BM) milieu to overcome drug resistance. Although Thal/IMiDs, PS-341, and As(2)O(3) inhibit nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, they also have multiple and varied other actions. In this study, we therefore specifically address the role of NF-kappaB blockade in mediating anti-MM activity. To characterize the effect of specific NF-kappaB blockade on MM cell growth and survival in vitro, we used an IkappaB kinase (IKK) inhibitor (PS-1145). Our studies demonstrate that PS-1145 and PS-341 block TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in MM cells through inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, respectively. Dexamethasone (Dex), which up-regulates IkappaBalpha protein, enhances blockade of NF-kappaB activation by PS-1145. Moreover, PS-1145 blocks the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apotosis. TNFalpha-induced intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression on both RPMI8226 and MM.1S cells is also inhibited by PS-1145. Moreover, PS-1145 inhibits both IL-6 secretion from BMSCs triggered by MM cell adhesion and proliferation of MM cells adherent to BMSCs. However, in contrast to PS-341, PS-1145 only partially (20-50{\%}) inhibits MM cell proliferation, suggesting that NF-kappaB blockade cannot account for all of the anti-MM activity of PS-341. Importantly, however, TNFalpha induces MM cell toxicity in the presence of PS-1145. These studies demonstrate that specific targeting of NF-kappaB can overcome the growth and survival advantage conferred both by tumor cell binding to BMSCs and cytokine secretion in the BM milieu. Furthermore, they provide the framework for clinical evaluation of novel MM therapies based upon targeting NF-kappaB.},

The maximum pressure is determined by the surface free energy of the liquid, the advancing contact angle of the liquid on the hydrophobic regions, and the channel depth. Surface-directed liquid flow was used to create pressure-sensitive switches inside channel networks. The ability to confine liquid flow inside microchannels with only two physical walls is expected to be useful in applications where a large gas-liquid interface is critical, as demonstrated here by a gas-liquid reaction.},

	Abstract = {Initial attachment of osteoblast cells and mineralization phenomena are generally enhanced on rough, sandblasted substrata. In the present work the effect of surface roughness of hydroxyapatite (HA) on human bone marrow cell response was investigated. Human bone marrow cells were plated onto HA disc-shaped pellets, prepared from synthetic HA powder. The pellets were sintered and polished with SiC paper 180-, 600- and 1200-grit, resulting in three surface roughness grades. Cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation (evaluated with the expression of ALP activity) were determined following various incubation periods. Cell detachment strength was determined as the shear stress required to detach a given quantity of the adherent cells from the different substrata, using a rotating disc device that applied a linear range of shear stresses to the cells. The cells attached and grew faster on culture plastic in comparison with HA. No statistically significant differences were observed in the expression of ALP activity on all three HA surfaces and culture plastic. Cell adhesion, proliferation and detachment strength were surface roughness sensitive and increased as the roughness of HA increased. The percentage of the adherent cells decreased in a sigmoidal mode as a function of the applied shear stress. In conclusion, surface roughness of HA generally improved the short- and longer-term response of bone marrow cells in vitro. This behavior could be explained by the selective adsorption of serum proteins.},

	Abstract = {In this study we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers only modest proliferation, as well as p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappaB activation, in MM.1S multiple myeloma (MM) cells. TNFalpha also activates NF-kappaB and markedly upregulates (fivefold) secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a myeloma growth and survival factor, in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). TNFalpha in both a dose and time dependent fashion induced expression of CD11a (LFA-1), CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1), CD106 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-1), CD49d (very late activating antigen-4, VLA-4), and/or MUC-1 on MM cell lines; as well as CD106 (VCAM-1) and CD54 (ICAM-1) expression on BMSCs. This resulted in increased (2-4-fold) per cent specific binding of MM cells to BMSCs, with related IL-6 secretion. Importantly, the proteasome inhibitor PS-341 abrogated TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, induction of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, and increased adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs. Agents which act to inhibit TNFalpha may therefore abrogate the paracrine growth and survival advantage conferred by MM cell adhesion in the BM microenvironment.},

	Abstract = {Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most powerful tools in regeneration medicine. Their low differentiation efficiency, however, limits further application of MSCs in clinical therapy. Here we report that a much higher multipotent differentiation efficiency of MSCs to adult cells can be achieved using a 3D spheroid culture method based on photolithography and micropatterning techniques. MSC spheroid of precise dimension and uniform quality cultured on the microdomain substrates was prepared first, and then was induced into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Both gene expression results from RT-PCR and morphology observation results revealed that the 3D spheroid culture method could greatly improve differentiation efficiency. Gene expression profiles obtained from gene microarray analysis confirmed the high differentiation efficiency and revealed that MSCs induced in 3D spheroid culture system regulated gene expression not only by increasing the expression levels of genes related to adipogenesis and osteogenesis, but also by down-regulating the gene maintaining MSCs' self-renewal phenotypes. We conclude that our 3D spheroid culture system contributes to an optimization for efficient differentiation of MSCs, offers insight into the mechanism of efficient differentiation of engineered 3D culture system, and has promise for wide applications in regeneration medicine and drug discovery fields.},

@article{Park2009,
	Abstract = {A novel protocol for the synthesis of biocompatible and degradation controlled poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) grafted hyaluronic acid (HA-PLGA) was successfully developed for periodontal barrier applications. HA was chemically modified with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) in the mixed solvent of water and ethanol, which resulted in a high degree of HA modification up to 85 mol.{\%}. The stability of HA-ADH to enzymatic degradation by hyaluronidase increased with ADH content in HA-ADH. When the ADH content in HA-ADH was higher than 80 mol.{\%}, HA-ADH became soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and could be grafted to the activated PLGA with N,N'-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The resulting HA-PLGA was used for the preparation of biphasic periodontal barrier membranes in chloroform. According to in vitro hydrolytic degradation tests in phosphate buffered saline, HA-PLGA/PLGA blend film with a weight ratio of 1/2 degraded relatively slowly compared to PLGA film and HA coated PLGA film. Four different samples of a control, OSSIX(TM) membrane, PLGA film, and HA-PLGA/PLGA film were assessed as periodontal barrier membranes for the calvarial critical size bone defects in SD rats. Histological and histomorphometric analyses revealed that HA-PLGA/PLGA film resulted in the most effective bone regeneration compared to other samples with a regenerated bone area of 63.1{\%} covering the bone defect area.},

	Abstract = {Although the in vitro expansion of the multiple myeloma (MM) clone has been unsuccessful, in a novel three-dimensional (3-D) culture model of reconstructed bone marrow (BM, n = 48) and mobilized blood autografts (n = 14) presented here, the entire MM clone proliferates and undergoes up to 17-fold expansion of malignant cells harboring the clonotypic IgH VDJ and characteristic chromosomal rearrangements. In this system, MM clone expands in a reconstructed microenvironment that is ideally suited for testing specificity of anti-MM therapeutics. In the 3-D model, melphalan and bortezomib had distinct targets, with melphalan targeting the hematopoietic, but not stromal com-partment. Bortezomib targeted only CD138(+)CD56(+) MM plasma cells. The localization of nonproliferating cells to the reconstructed endosteum, in contact with N-cadherin-positive stroma, suggested the presence of MM-cancer stem cells. These drug-resistant CD20(+) cells were enriched more than 10-fold by melphalan treatment, exhibited self-renewal, and generated clonotypic B and plasma cell progeny in colony forming unit assays. This is the first molecularly verified demonstration of proliferation in vitro by ex vivo MM cells. The 3-D culture provides a novel biologically relevant preclinical model for evaluating therapeutic vulnerabilities of all compartments of the MM clone, including presumptive drug-resistant MM stem cells.},

	Abstract = {Syndecan-1 is a cell membrane proteoglycan that binds extracellular matrix components and various growth factors. It is expressed only on malignant plasma cells in bone marrow samples from patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Several reports have suggested that syndecan-1 was present only on a part of the myeloma cells. By using either IL-6-dependent myeloma cell lines or primary myeloma cells stained by annexin V, we report here that syndecan-1 was rapidly lost by myeloma cells undergoing apoptosis. In the same experimental conditions, expression of other cell membrane antigens such as CD38, HLA class-I or CD49d on apoptotic myeloma cells was not affected. In addition, we show that syndecan-1 loss was independent of activation of the gp130 IL-6 transducer. Dexamethasone induced a strong apoptosis of myeloma cells associated with the loss of syndecan-1. Finally, by using freshly-explanted tumoural samples, we show that syndecan-1 rapidly disappeared from myeloma cells in association with induction of apoptosis. In conclusion we showed that syndecan-1 is a marker for viable myeloma cells which is rapidly lost by apoptotic cells. These results emphasize the usefulness of anti-syndecan-1 antibodies to purge tumoural cells from haemopoietic grafts or to purify these cells for further manipulations for immuno or gene therapies.},

	Abstract = {Background/Purpose: Previous studies have shown that intestinal crypt cell transplantation using biodegradable scaffolds can generate stratified epithelium reminiscent of embryonic gut. The authors propose to tissue engineer small intestine on biodegradable scaffolds by transplanting intestinal epithelial organoid units, which maintain the epithelial mesenchymal cell-cell interaction necessary for epithelial survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Methods: Intestinal epithelial organoid units were isolated from neonatal Lewis rats by enzyme digestion and differential sedimentation. Organoid units were seeded on to tubular scaffolds made of nonwoven polyglycolic acid (PGA) sprayed with 5{\%} polylactic acid (PLA). Polymers either were coated (28 constructs) or noncoated (33 constructs) with collagen type I. A total of 61 organoid unit polymer constructs were implanted into 61 animals. Animals were killed and constructs harvested at 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14 weeks. Results: Histological analysis showed formation of neomucosa characterized by columnar epithelium with goblet, and paneth cells were evident in 47 of the 61 constructs. The outer walls were composed of fibrovascular tissue, degradable polymer, extracellular matrix, and smooth muscle-like cells. Immunofluorescent microscopy showed apical staining of brush border enzymes, sucrase and lactase, and basolateral staining for laminin, indicating the establishment of cell polarity. Electrophysiology of Ussing-chambered neomucosa and adult ileal mucosa exhibited similar transepithelial resistance. Conclusion: There results suggest that intestinal crypt cells heterotopically transplanted as epithelial organoid units on PGA-PLA tubular scaffolds can survive, reorganize, and regenerate complex composite tissue resembling small intestine demonstrating organ morphogenesis, cytodifferentiation, and phenotypic maturation.},

Although it is traditionally thought to control transcriptional activation through the classical nuclear estrogen receptors, it also initiates many rapid nongenomic signaling events. We found that of all G protein-coupled receptors characterized to date, GPR30 is uniquely localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it specifically binds estrogen and fluorescent estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30 by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Thus, GPR30 represents an intracellular transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen physiology as well as pathophysiology.},

	Abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen that colonizes approximately 50{\%} of the world's population. Infection with H. pylori causes chronic inflammation and significantly increases the risk of developing duodenal and gastric ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Infection with H. pylori is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Once H. pylori colonizes the gastric environment, it persists for the lifetime of the host, suggesting that the host immune response is ineffective in clearing this bacterium. In this review, we discuss the host immune response and examine other host factors that increase the pathogenic potential of this bacterium, including host polymorphisms, alterations to the apical-junctional complex, and the effects of environmental factors. In addition to host effects and responses, H. pylori strains are genetically diverse. We discuss the main virulence determinants in H. pylori strains and the correlation between these and the diverse clinical outcomes following H. pylori infection. Since H. pylori inhibits the gastric epithelium of half of the world, it is crucial that we continue to gain understanding of host and microbial factors that increase the risk of developing more severe clinical outcomes.},

	Abstract = {The microorganisms that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract comprise a complex ecosystem with functions that significantly contribute to our systemic metabolism and have an impact on health and disease. In line with its importance, the human gastrointestinal microbiota has been extensively studied. Despite the fact that a significant part of the intestinal microorganisms has not yet been cultured, presently over 1000 different microbial species that can reside in the human gastrointestinal tract have been identified. This review provides a systematic overview and detailed references of the total of 1057 intestinal species of Eukarya (92), Archaea (8) and Bacteria (957), based on the phylogenetic framework of their small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Moreover, it unifies knowledge about the prevalence, abundance, stability, physiology, genetics and the association with human health of these gastrointestinal microorganisms, which is currently scattered over a vast amount of literature published in the last 150 years. This detailed physiological and genetic information is expected to be instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Moreover, it opens avenues for future comparative and functional metagenomic and other high-throughput approaches that need a systematic and physiological basis to have an impact.},

	Abstract = {For this work, two different plastic microfluidic devices are designed and fabricated for applications in high-throughput residue analysis of food contaminants and drug screening of small-molecule libraries. Microfluidic networks on copolyester and poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates are fabricated by silicon template imprinting and capillary molding techniques. The first device is developed to perform affinity capture, concentration, and direct identification of targeted compounds using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) membranes sandwiched between the imprinted copolyester microchannels in an integrated platform provide continuous affinity dialysis and concentration of a reaction mixture containing aflatoxin B1 antibody and aflatoxins. The second microfluidic device is composed of microchannels on the poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates. The device is designed to perform miniaturized ultrafiltration of affinity complexes of phenobarbital antibody and barbiturates, including the sequential loading, washing, and dissociation steps. These microfabricated devices not only significantly reduce dead volume and sample consumption but also increase the detection sensitivity by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude over those reported previously. Improvements in detection sensitivity are attributed to analyte preconcentration during the affinity purification step, limited analyte dilution in the microdialysis junction, minimal sample loss, and the amenability of ESI-MS to nanoscale sample flow rates.},

In contrast to conventional cell culture, handling of microtissues poses new challenges such as medium exchange, purification and maintenance of the microtissue integrity. Here, we developed magnetic microcryogels to assist microtissue formation with enhanced controllability and robustness. The magnetic microcryogels were fabricated on-chip by cryogelation and micro-molding which could endure extensive external forces such as fluidic shear stress during pipetting and syringe injection. The magnetically controllable microtissues were applied to constitute a novel separable 3D co-culture system realizing functional enhancement of the hepatic microtissues co-cultured with the stromal microtissues and easy purification of the hepatic microtissues for downstream drug testing. The magnetically controllable microtissues with pre-defined shapes were also applied as building blocks to accelerate the tissue assembly process under magnetic force for bottom-up tissue engineering. Finally, the magnetic microcryogels could be injected in vivo as cell delivery vehicles and tracked by MRI. The injectable magnetic microtissues maintained viability at the injection site indicating good retention and potential applications for cell therapy. The magnetic microcryogels are expected to significantly promote the microtissues as a promising cellular configuration for cell-based applications such as in drug testing, tissue engineering and regenerative therapy.},

	Abstract = {Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to the treatment of many hematopoietic malignancies such as multiple myeloma. Although much research has been focused on acquired resistance phenotypes, we believe that de novo drug resistance mechanisms may be an important component in protecting cells from initial drug exposure. It is now realized that many of the biological processes associated with this disease, including cell survival, may come as a result of the direct interactions of malignant plasma cells with the bone marrow microenvironment. This review examines the role of cell adhesion to one bone marrow component, fibronectin (FN), and the impact it may have on response to cytotoxic drugs. We discuss the influence of the integrin VLA-4 (alpha4beta1) on cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) as well as the effects of chronic drug exposure on integrin function. Data presented here demonstrates that drug selection can make a non-adherent cell line adherent to FN through inside-out integrin activation and consequently cause a decrease in sensitivity to drug. We also speculate on the possible mediators of this intrinsic mechanism of drug resistance which may, along with the integrins themselves, become promising therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to delineate the biological significance of IkappaB kinase (IKK) beta inhibition in multiple myeloma cells in the context of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) using a novel IKKbeta inhibitor MLN120B.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Growth-inhibitory effect of MLN120B in multiple myeloma cells in the presence of cytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1)], conventional agents (dexamethasone, melphalan, and doxorubicin), or BMSC was assessed in vitro. In vivo anti-multiple myeloma activity of MLN120B was evaluated in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-hu model.

RESULTS: MLN120B inhibits both baseline and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced nuclear factor-kappaB activation, associated with down-regulation of IkappaBalpha and p65 nuclear factor-kappaB phosphorylation. MLN120B triggers 25{\%} to 90{\%} growth inhibition in a dose-dependent fashion in multiple myeloma cell lines and significantly augments tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced cytotoxicity in MM.1S cells. MLN120B augments growth inhibition triggered by doxorubicin and melphalan in both RPMI 8226 and IL-6-dependent INA6 cell lines. Neither IL-6 nor IGF-1 overcomes the growth-inhibitory effect of MLN120B. MLN120B inhibits constitutive IL-6 secretion by BMSCs by 70{\%} to 80{\%} without affecting viability. Importantly, MLN120B almost completely blocks stimulation of MM.1S, U266, and INA6 cell growth, as well as IL-6 secretion from BMSCs, induced by multiple myeloma cell adherence to BMSCs. MLN120B overcomes the protective effect of BMSCs against conventional (dexamethasone) therapy.

CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the novel IKKbeta inhibitor MLN120B induces growth inhibition of multiple myeloma cells in SCID-hu mouse model. These studies provide the framework for clinical evaluation of MLN120B, alone and in combined therapies, trials of these novel agents to improve patient outcome in multiple myeloma.},

	Abstract = {Nucleic acid (NA) extraction and purification has become a common technique in both research and clinical laboratories. Current methods require repetitive wash steps with a pipet that are laborious and time-consuming, making the procedure inefficient for clinical settings. We present here a simple technique that relies on spontaneous biphasic plug flow inside a capillary to achieve sample preparation. By filling the sample with oil, aqueous contaminants were displaced from the captured NA without pipetting wash buffers or use of external force and equipment. mRNA from mammalian cell culture was purified, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification showed similar threshold cycle values as those obtained from a commercially available kit. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-like particles were spiked into serum and a 5-fold increase in viral RNA extraction yield was achieved compared to the conventional wash method. In addition, viral RNA was successfully purified from human whole blood, and a limit of detection of approximately 14 copies of RNA extracted per sample was determined. The results demonstrate the utility of the current technique for nucleic acid purification for clinical purposes, and the overall approach provides a potential method to implement nucleic acid testing in low-resource settings.},

	Abstract = {Selectin-mediated tumor cell tethering to host cells, such as vascular endothelial cells, is a critical step in the process of cancer metastasis. We recently identified sialofucosylated mucin16 (MUC16) and podocalyxin (PODXL) as the major functional E- and L-selectin ligands expressed on the surface of metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. While the biophysics of leukocyte binding to selectins has been well studied, little is known about the mechanics of selectin-mediated adhesion pertinent to cancer metastasis. We thus sought to evaluate the critical parameters of selectin-mediated pancreatic tumor cell tethering and rolling. Using force spectroscopy, we characterized the binding interactions of MUC16 and PODXL to E- and L-selectin at the single-molecule level. To further analyze the response of these molecular interactions under physiologically relevant regimes, we used a microfluidic assay in conjunction with a mathematical model to study the biophysics of selectin-ligand binding as a function of fluid shear stress. We demonstrate that both MUC16 and PODXL-E-selectin-mediated interactions are mechanically stronger than like L-selectin interactions at the single-molecule level, and display a higher binding frequency at all contact times. The single-molecule kinetic and micromechanical properties of selectin-ligand bonds, along with the number of receptor-ligand bonds needed to initiate tethering, regulate the average velocity of ligand-coated microspheres rolling on selectin-coated surfaces in shear flow. Understanding the biophysics of selectin-ligand bonds and their responses to physiologically relevant shear stresses is vital for developing diagnostic assays and/or preventing the metastatic spread of tumor cells by interfering with selectin-mediated adhesion.},

In recent years, because of the rapid development of MEMS and micromachining, many applications of the capillary flow is widely developing in some modern processes, such as underfilling of flip chip, flow in microfluidic chip or biochip, and a variety of other fields. In this study, the theoretical mathematical model of flow in microchannel driven by capillary force and gravity is formulated from the Navier--Stokes equations. A close form solution to predict flow time was developed, and experiments have been set up to investigate and verify the flow times in microchannels. From the results, the predicted flow times show reasonably good agreement with the corresponding experimental flow times.

@article{Zimmermann2005a,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for programming the flow rate of liquids inside open microfluidic networks (MFNs). A MFN comprises a number of independent flow paths, each of which starts with an open filling port, has a sealed microchannel in which assays can be performed, and an open capillary pump (CP). The MFN is placed over Peltier elements and its flow paths initially fill owing to capillary forces when liquids are added to the filling ports. A cooling Peltier element underneath the filling ports dynamically prevents evaporation in all filling ports using the ambient temperature and relative humidity as inputs. Another Peltier element underneath the CPs heats the pumps thereby inducing evaporation in the CPs and setting the flow rate in the microchannels. This method achieves flow rates in the microchannels ranging from approximately 1.2 nL s(-1) to approximately 30 pL s(-1), and is able to keep 90{\%} of a 0.6 microL solution placed in an open filling port for 60 min. This simple and efficient method should be applicable to numerous assays or chemical reactions that require small and precise flow of liquids and reagents inside microfluidics.},

@article{Thompson2013b,
	Abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that exosomes play a key role in tumor-host cross-talk and that exosome secretion, composition, and functional capacity are altered as tumors progress to an aggressive phenotype. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate these changes. Heparanase is an enzyme whose expression is up-regulated as tumors become more aggressive and is associated with enhanced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. We have discovered that in human cancer cells (myeloma, lymphoblastoid, and breast cancer), when expression of heparanase is enhanced or when tumor cells are exposed to exogenous heparanase, exosome secretion is dramatically increased. Heparanase enzyme activity is required for robust enhancement of exosome secretion because enzymatically inactive forms of heparanase, even when present in high amounts, do not dramatically increase exosome secretion. Heparanase also impacts exosome protein cargo as reflected by higher levels of syndecan-1, VEGF, and hepatocyte growth factor in exosomes secreted by heparanase-high expressing cells as compared with heparanase-low expressing cells. In functional assays, exosomes from heparanase-high cells stimulated spreading of tumor cells on fibronectin and invasion of endothelial cells through extracellular matrix better than did exosomes secreted by heparanase-low cells. These studies reveal that heparanase helps drive exosome secretion, alters exosome composition, and facilitates production of exosomes that impact both tumor and host cell behavior, thereby promoting tumor progression.},

	Abstract = {Mechanical forces are important modulators of cellular function in many tissues and are particularly important in the cardiovascular system. The endothelium, by virtue of its unique location in the vessel wall, responds rapidly and sensitively to the mechanical conditions created by blood flow and the cardiac cycle. In this study, we examine data which suggest that steady laminar shear stress stimulates cellular responses that are essential for endothelial cell function and are atheroprotective. We explore the ability of shear stress to modulate atherogenesis via its effects on endothelial-mediated alterations in coagulation, leukocyte and monocyte migration, smooth muscle growth, lipoprotein uptake and metabolism, and endothelial cell survival. We also propose a model of signal transduction for the endothelial cell response to shear stress including possible mechanotransducers (integrins, caveolae, ion channels, and G proteins), intermediate signaling molecules (c-Src, ras, Raf, protein kinase C) and the mitogen activated protein kinases (ERK1/2, JNK, p38, BMK-1), and effector molecules (nitric oxide). The endothelial cell response to shear stress may also provide a mechanism by which risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and sedentary lifestyle act to promote atherosclerosis.},

	Abstract = {The interleukin 6/glycoprotein 130/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/gp130/STAT3) pathway has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) and for survival of MM cells. However, most data concerning the role of IL-6 and IL-6-triggered signaling pathways were obtained from experiments performed with MM cell lines and without considering the bone marrow microenvironment. Thus, the precise role of IL-6 and its intracellular signaling pathways for survival of human MM cells is still unclear. Here we show that treatment of human MM cells (IL-6-dependent MM cell line INA-6 and primary MM cells) with the IL-6 receptor antagonist Sant7 or with an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induced apoptosis if the cells were cultured in the absence of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). In contrast, apoptosis could not be observed if the MM cells were cocultured with BMSCs. The analysis of intracellular pathways revealed that Sant7 and anti-gp130 mAb were effectively inhibiting the phosphorylation of gp130 and STAT3 in the absence and presence of BMSCs, whereas ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1,2) phosphorylation was only slightly affected. In contrast, treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, FPT III, induced apoptosis in MM cells in the absence or presence of BMSCs and led to a complete inhibition of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These observations indicate that the IL-6/gp130/STAT3 pathway is not essential for survival of human myeloma cells if they are grown in the presence of cells from the bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, we provide evidence that farnesyl transferase inhibitors might be useful for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MM.},

	Abstract = {We present an experimental and theoretical analysis of i.r. (thermal) sintering of thermosetting resins used for stereolithography. In the experimental work an epoxy resin was chosen. The optimum mix (which was quite critical) was composed of 10 parts (by weight), 1.4 parts diethylene triamine and 0.7 parts of silica powder. Using a differential scanning calorimeter (d.s.c.) we were able to determine reaction rates as a function of temperature as well as the enthalpy ($\Delta$H ≅ 368 J g−1) involved in the phase transition and the activation energy (21.7 $\pm$ 0.9 kJ mol−1) of the sintering process. The solution of the heat equation simulating this process was in general agreement with our previous observations of the stereolithographic results. It was also found that the minimum radius of lateral confinement was limited to ∼0.3 mm due to heat conduction. The absorption depth should be approximately the same (0.2 mm in this case) at the frequency of the laser. It was also noticed that the epoxy degrades rapidly at temperatures above ∼280$\,^{\circ}$C.},

	Abstract = {Removal of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) from their native environment alters the biochemical and mechanical signals responsible for maintaining normal cell function, causing a shift from a quiescent, contractile phenotype to a more proliferative, synthetic state. We examined the effect on SMC function of culture on two-dimensional (2D) substrates and in three-dimensional (3D) collagen Type I gels, including the effect of exogenous biochemical stimulation on gel compaction, cell proliferation, and expression of the contractile protein smooth muscle $\alpha$-actin (SMA) in these systems. Embedding of SMC in 3D collagen matrices caused a marked decrease in both cell proliferation and expression of SMA. The presence of the extracellular matrix modulated cellular responses to platelet-derived growth factor BB, heparin, transforming growth factor-$\beta$1, and endothelial cell-conditioned medium. Cell proliferation and SMA expression were shown to be inversely related, while gel compaction and SMA expression were not correlated. Taken together, these results show that SMC phenotype and function can be modulated using biochemical stimulation in vitro, but that the effects produced are dependent on the nature of the extracellular matrix. These findings have implications for the study of vascular biology in vitro, as well as for the development of engineered vascular tissues.},

	Abstract = {Embryonic stem (ES) cells have tremendous potential as a cell source for cell-based therapies. Realization of that potential will depend on our ability to understand and manipulate the factors that influence cell fate decisions and to develop scalable methods of cell production. We compared four standard ES cell differentiation culture systems by measuring aspects of embryoid body (EB) formation efficiency and cell proliferation, and by tracking development of a specific differentiated tissue type-blood-using functional (colony-forming cell) and phenotypic (Flk-1 and CD34 expression) assays. We report that individual murine ES cells form EBs with an efficiency of 42 +/- 9{\%}, but this value is rarely obtained because of EB aggregation-a process whereby two or more individual ES cells or EBs fuse to form a single, larger cell aggregate. Regardless of whether EBs were generated from a single ES cell in methylcellulose or liquid suspension culture, or aggregates of ES cells in hanging drop culture, they grew to a similar maximum cell number of 28,000 +/- 9,000 cells per EB. Among the three methods for EB generation in suspension culture there were no differences in the kinetics or frequency of hematopoietic development. Thus, initiating EBs with a single ES cell and preventing EB aggregation should allow for maximum yield of differentiated cells in the EB system. EB differentiation cultures were also compared to attached differentiation culture using the same outputs. Attached colonies were not similarly limited in cell number; however, hematopoietic development in attached culture was impaired. The percentage of early Flk-1 and CD34 expressing cells was dramatically lower than in EBs cultured in suspension, whereas hematopoietic colony formation was almost completely inhibited. These results provide a foundation for development of efficient, scalable bioprocesses for ES cell differentiation, and inform novel methods for the production of hematopoietic tissues.},

	Abstract = {The hanging droplet technique for three-dimensional tissue culture has been used for decades in biology labs, with the core technology remaining relatively unchanged. Recently microscale approaches have expanded the capabilities of the hanging droplet method, making it more user-friendly. We present a spontaneously driven, open hanging droplet culture platform to address many limitations of current platforms. Our platform makes use of two interconnected hanging droplet wells, a larger well where cells are cultured and a smaller well for user interface via a pipette. The two-well system results in lower shear stress in the culture well during fluid exchange, enabling shear sensitive or non-adherent cells to be cultured in a droplet. The ability to perform fluid exchanges in-droplet enables long-term culture, treatment, and characterization without disruption of the culture. The open well format of the platform was utilized to perform time-dependent coculture, enabling culture configurations with bone tissue scaffolds and cells grown in suspension. The open nature of the system allowed the direct addition or removal of tissue over the course of an experiment, manipulations that would be impractical in other microfluidic or hanging droplet culture platforms.},

	Abstract = {Microfluidic laboratory-on-a-chip (LOC) systems based on a modular architecture are presented. The architecture is conceptualized on two levels: a single-chip level and a multiple-chip module (MCM) system level. At the individual chip level, a multilayer approach segregates components belonging to two fundamental categories: passive fluidic components (channels and reaction chambers) and active electromechanical control structures (sensors and actuators). This distinction is explicitly made to simplify the development process and minimize cost. Components belonging to these two categories are built separately on different physical layers and can communicate fluidically via cross-layer interconnects. The chip that hosts the electromechanical control structures is called the microfluidic breadboard (FBB). A single LOC module is constructed by attaching a chip comprised of a custom arrangement of fluid routing channels and reactors (passive chip) to the FBB. Many different LOC functions can be achieved by using different passive chips on an FBB with a standard resource configuration. Multiple modules can be interconnected to form a larger LOC system (MCM level). We demonstrated the utility of this architecture by developing systems for two separate biochemical applications: one for detection of protein markers of cancer and another for detection of metal ions. In the first case, free prostate-specific antigen was detected at 500 aM concentration by using a nanoparticle-based bio-bar-code protocol on a parallel MCM system. In the second case, we used a DNAzyme-based biosensor to identify the presence of Pb(2+) (lead) at a sensitivity of 500 nM in {\textless}1 nl of solution.},

	Abstract = {Commercially pure titanium (c.p.Ti) is capable of inducing the formation of a carbonated apatite onto its surface in a simulated body fluid (SBF) comprised of calcium ions, phosphate ions, and other inorganic species present in the body fluid. In addition to the incorporation of carbonate ions, such formed apatite has other important characteristics of the bone mineral phase, such as a small crystal size and ionic substitution by Mg2+ and Cl-. Thus, we call this apatite a quasi-biological apatite. The formation of the quasi-biological apatite is proposed to be related to TiOH groups that develop on the titanium surface through interaction with the SBF. The results suggest that titanium implants may be activated such that they can form a strong bond with bone tissue through the in vivo formation of apatite. Since the solution can reach any open space, the process discussed in this study is very suitable for coating porous titanium implants with a quasi-biological apatite film.},

	Abstract = {Existing in vitro models of human intestinal function commonly rely on use of established epithelial cell lines, such as Caco-2 cells, which form polarized epithelial monolayers but fail to mimic more complex intestinal functions that are required for drug development and disease research. We show here that a microfluidic 'Gut-on-a-Chip' technology that exposes cultured cells to physiological peristalsis-like motions and liquid flow can be used to induce human Caco-2 cells to spontaneously undergo robust morphogenesis of three-dimensional (3D) intestinal villi. The cells of that line these villus structures are linked by tight junctions, and covered by brush borders and mucus. They also reconstitute basal proliferative crypts that populate the villi along the crypt-villus axis, and form four different types of differentiated epithelial cells (absorptive, mucus-secretory, enteroendocrine, and Paneth) that take characteristic positions similar to those observed in living human small intestine. Formation of these intestinal villi also results in exposure of increased intestinal surface area that mimics the absorptive efficiency of human intestine, as well enhanced cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform-based drug metabolizing activity compared to conventional Caco-2 cell monolayers cultured in a static Transwell system. The ability of the human Gut-on-a-Chip to recapitulate the 3D structures, differentiated cell types, and multiple physiological functions of normal human intestinal villi may provide a powerful alternative in vitro model for studies on intestinal physiology and digestive diseases, as well as drug development.},

	Abstract = {Coculture has emerged as a strategy to improve chondrogenesisof mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage regeneration. In the present study, a new system integrating cell encapsulation, dynamic stimulation and coculture with articular chondrocytes (ACs), termed as three-dimensional (3D) dynamic coculture, was developed for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. In addition, a novel mechanism was exploited to enable facile separation of cocultured cells. Rabbit bone-marrow derived MSCs (rMSCs) and rabbit ACs (rACs) were encapsualted in alginate gel beads, respectively. In rACs-laden beads, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were incorporated. Dynamic coculture was performed in a spinner flask. Fe3O4 nanoparticles had no negative effects on growth of rACs, although a slight inhibition on production of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) by rACs was noticed. An alginate concentration of above 1.8w/v{\%} was favorable for dynamic culture of rMSCs and rACs. Coculturing rMSCs with rACs in chondrogenic medium in this system demonstrated an improved chondrogenesis than monocultured rMSCs according to GAG quantification, histological staining, and gene expression analysis of collagen I, II and X. However, supplementation of 2{\%} FBS did not show posive effects on chondrogenesis of cocultured rMSCs. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that such a separable 3D dynamic coculture system holds great potential in cartilage tissue regeneration.},

Strikingly, the angiogenic characteristics of tumor cells were dramatically altered upon 3D culture within this system, and corresponded much more closely to tumors formed in vivo. Cells in this model were also less sensitive to chemotherapy and yielded tumors with enhanced malignant potential. We assessed the broad relevance of these findings with 3D culture of other tumor cell lines in this same model, comparison with standard 3D Matrigel culture and in vivo experiments. This new biomimetic model may provide a broadly applicable 3D culture system to study the effect of microenvironmental conditions on tumor malignancy in vitro and in vivo.},

We developed a plug and play microfluidic device composed of a fluid driving unit and a polymer chip containing microfluidic channels and reservoirs. The one and only connection of the device to the external world is a set of electric control lines for the driving unit. Just putting the reagents and samples onto the reservoirs, the chip can be operated for chemical or biochemical reaction and analysis. We demonstrate here that silicon-based micropumps embedded in the present device allow us to achieve flexible fluidic manipulations with minimum time delay and dead volume.},

They provide a compartment in which species or reactions can be isolated, they are monodisperse and therefore suitable for quantitative studies, they offer the possibility to work with extremely small volumes, single cells, or single molecules, and are suitable for high-throughput experiments. The aim of this Review is to show the importance of these features in enabling new experiments in biology and chemistry. The recent advances in device fabrication are highlighted as are the remaining technological challenges. Examples are presented to show how compartmentalization, monodispersity, single-molecule sensitivity, and high throughput have been exploited in experiments that would have been extremely difficult outside the microfluidics platform.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Testicular germ cell tumours of young adults, seminoma or non-seminomas, are preceded by a pre-invasive precursor, carcinoma in situ (CIS), understood to arise through differentiation arrest of embryonic germ cells. Knowledge about the malignant transformation of germ cells is currently limited by the lack of experimental models. The aim of this study was to establish an experimental tissue culture model to maintain normal and malignant germ cells within their niche and allow investigation of treatment effects.

METHODS: Human testis and testis cancer specimens from orchidectomies were cultured in 'hanging drops' and effects of activin A and follistatin treatment were investigated in seminoma cultures.

RESULTS: Testis fragments with normal spermatogenesis or CIS cells were cultured for 14 days with sustained proliferation of germ cells and CIS cells and without increased apoptosis. Seminoma cultures survived 7 days, with proliferating cells detectable during the first 5 days. Activin A treatment significantly reduced KIT transcript and protein levels in seminoma cultures, thereby demonstrating a specific treatment response.

CONCLUSIONS: Hanging drop cultures of human testis and testis cancer samples can be employed to delineate mechanisms governing growth of normal, CIS and tumorigenic germ cells retained within their niche.},

@article{Molina2011,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Androgen receptor signaling remains essential for many prostate cancers that have progressed despite androgen deprivation therapy. After medical or surgical castration persistent though not insignificant low levels of androgens are produced from nongonadal sources, such as the adrenal glands. Some castration resistant prostate cancers acquire the ability to convert adrenal steroids to androgens, maintaining levels sufficient to activate androgen receptor. Inhibition of persistent androgen production and androgen receptor mediated signaling are relevant therapeutic strategies for castration resistant prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The scientific foundation of and clinical experience with secondary hormonal therapy as well as the development of new investigational agents for castration resistant prostate cancer, specifically selective cytochrome p450 17 inhibitors and second generation antiandrogens, are discussed.

RESULTS: Selective inhibition of cytochrome p450 17 has emerged as an important therapeutic pathway for castration resistant prostate cancer. The selective cytochrome p450 17 inhibitor abiraterone acetate showed promising activity and tolerability in phase I-II trials. Phase III studies are underway in men with chemotherapy na{\"{i}}ve castration resistant prostate cancer as well as those with progression after docetaxel based chemotherapy. TAK-700 and TOK-001 (formerly VN124-1) are novel selective cytochrome p450 17 inhibitors that recently entered phase I/II evaluation. MDV3100 is a second generation antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptor signaling by inhibiting nuclear translocation of the ligand-receptor complex. Clinical data on MDV3100 are encouraging and support continued phase III study.

CONCLUSIONS: Novel therapies for castration resistant prostate cancer that target persistent androgen production and androgen receptor mediated signaling have demonstrated promising activity in many men with castration resistant prostate cancer and may redefine the clinical management of these patients.},

@article{Lee2012,
	Abstract = {In this study, we suggest in situ islet spheroid formation and encapsulation on a single platform without replating as a method for producing mono-disperse spheroids and minimizing damage to spheroids during encapsulation. Using this approach, the size of spheroid can be controlled by modulating the size of the concave well. Here, we used 300 $\mu$m concave wells to reduce spheroid size and thereby eliminating the central necrosis caused by large volume. As the encapsulation material, we used alginate and collagen-alginate composite (CAC), and evaluated their suitability through diverse in vitro tests, including measurements of viability, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), hypoxic damage to encapsulated spheroids, and insulin secretion. For in situ encapsulation, alginate or CAC was spread over a concave microwell array containing spheroids, and CaCl(2) solution was diffused through a nano-porous dialysis membrane to achieve uniform polymerization, forming convex structures. By this process, the formation of uniform-size islet spheroids and their encapsulation without an intervening replating step was successfully performed. As a control, intact islets were evaluated concurrently. The in vitro test demonstrated excellent performance of CAC-encapsulated spheroids, and on the basis of these results, we transplanted the islet spheroids-encapsulated with CAC into the intraperitoneal cavity of mice with induced diabetes for 4 weeks, and evaluated subsequent glucose control. Intact islets were also transplanted as control to investigate the effect of encapsulation. Transplanted CAC-encapsulated islet spheroids maintained glucose levels below 200 mg/dL for 4 weeks, at which they were still active. At the end of the implantation experiment, we carried out intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) in mice to investigate whether the implanted islets remained responsive to glucose. The glucose level in mice with CAC-encapsulated islet spheroids dropped below 200 mg/dL 60 min after glucose injection and was stably maintained. In conclusion, the proposed encapsulation method enhances the viability and function of islet spheroids, and protects these spheroids from immune attack.},

	Abstract = {Strategies to engineer bone have focused on the use of natural or synthetic degradable materials as scaffolds for cell transplantation or as substrates to guide bone regeneration. The basic requirements of the scaffold material are biocompatibility, degradability, mechanical integrity, and osteoconductivity. A major design problem is satisfying each of these requirements with a single scaffold material. This study addresses this problem by describing an approach to combine the biocompatibility and degradability of a polymer scaffold with the osteoconductivity and mechanical reinforcement of a bonelike mineral film. We report the nucleation and growth of a continuous carbonated apatite mineral on the interior pore surfaces of a porous, degradable polymer scaffold via a one step, room temperature incubation process. A 3-dimensional, porous scaffold of the copolymer 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) was fabricated by a solvent casting, particulate leaching process. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis after different incubation times in a simulated body fluid (SBF) demonstrate the growth of a continuous bonelike apatite layer within the pores of the polymer scaffold. Quantification of phosphate on the scaffold displays the growth and development of the mineral film over time with an incorporation of 0.43 mg of phosphate (equivalent to 0.76 mg of hydroxyapatite) per scaffold after 14 days in SBF. The compressive moduli of polymer scaffolds increased fivefold with formation of a mineral film after a 16-day incubation time as compared to control scaffolds. In summary, this biomimetic treatment provides a simple, one step, room temperature method for surface functionalization and subsequent mineral nucleation and growth on biodegradable polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering.},

	Abstract = {Adhesion of multiple myeloma (MM) cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) not only localizes MM cells in the marrow microenvironment, but also triggers interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion by BMSCs and related MM cell proliferation. In the present study, we characterized the regulation of IL-6 gene expression in BMSCs during MM cell adhesion. Adhesion of ARH-77, HS-Sultan, IM-9, and U266 MM cell lines to BMSCs and BMSC lines (LP 101 and AA 101) triggered 5-through 15-fold and 2-through 4-fold increases in IL-6 secretion, respectively. IL-6 mRNA transcripts were undetectable by Northern blotting in IM-9 MM cells or LP 101 BMSCs cultured alone; however, adherence of IM-9 cells to LP 101 cells induced a transient increase in IL-6 transcripts at 6 hours, followed by peak IL-6 secretion at 24 hours. To confirm increased IL-6 transcription and characterize its regulation, LP101 BMSCs were transiently transfected with full length and deletion fragments of the IL-6 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Transient transfection of LP101 BMSCs with plasmid containing an intact NF-kappa B site showed a 6.8 +/- 0.4-fold increase in CAT activity triggered by IM-9 MM cell adhesion (n = 3, P {\textless} .05). Transfection of LP 101 cells with plasmid containing a single base pair deletion from the NF-kapp B binding motif abolished the MM adhesion-induced increase in CAT activity, whereas transfection with plasmid containing three copies of synthetic NF-kappa B sequence resulted in an 8.1 +/- 0.7-fold increase in CAT activity related to MM adhesion (n = 3, P {\textless} .05). These data suggest that the NF-kappa B site is one of the essential regulatory elements for MM cell adhesion-induced IL-6 transcription in BMSCs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the involvement of NF-kappa B activation in regulating MM adhesion-induced IL-6 transcription in BMSCs. Further characterization of the upstream events in the signalling cascade regulating IL-6 may not only delineate mechanisms of IL-6 regulation during paracrine MM cell growth, but also provide new therapeutic strategies based on interruption of IL-6 mediated tumor cell growth.},

By recapitulating the multicellular architectures, tissue-tissue interfaces, physicochemical microenvironments and vascular perfusion of the body, these devices produce levels of tissue and organ functionality not possible with conventional 2D or 3D culture systems. They also enable high-resolution, real-time imaging and in vitro analysis of biochemical, genetic and metabolic activities of living cells in a functional tissue and organ context. This technology has great potential to advance the study of tissue development, organ physiology and disease etiology. In the context of drug discovery and development, it should be especially valuable for the study of molecular mechanisms of action, prioritization of lead candidates, toxicity testing and biomarker identification.},

The surface used in this report is, more specifically, an electrode covered with dielectrics, hence, called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). All the fluidic movement is confined between two plates, which we call parallel-plate channel, rather than through closed channels or on open surfaces. While transporting and merging droplets are easily verified, we discover that there exists a design criterion for a given set of materials beyond which the droplet simply cannot be cut by EWOD mechanism. The condition for successful cutting is theoretically analyzed by examining the channel gap, the droplet size and the degree of contact angle change by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD). A series of experiments is run and verifies the criterion.},

	Abstract = {Clinical protocols utilize bone marrow to seed synthetic and decellularized allogeneic bone grafts for enhancement of scaffold remodeling and fusion. Marrow-derived cytokines induce host neovascularization at the graft surface, but hypoxic conditions cause cell death at the core. Addition of cellular components that generate an extensive primitive plexus-like vascular network that would perfuse the entire scaffold upon anastomosis could potentially yield significantly higher-quality grafts. We used a mouse model to develop a two-stage protocol for generating vascularized bone grafts using mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from human bone marrow and umbilical cord-derived endothelial cells. The endothelial cells formed tube-like structures and subsequently networks throughout the bone scaffold 4-7 days after implantation. hMSCs were essential for stable vasculature both in vitro and in vivo; however, contrary to expectations, vasculature derived from hMSCs briefly cultured in medium designed to maintain a proliferative, nondifferentiated state was more extensive and stable than that with hMSCs with a TGF-beta-induced smooth muscle cell phenotype. Anastomosis occurred by day 11, with most hMSCs associating closely with the network. Although initially immature and highly permeable, at 4 weeks the network was mature. Initiation of scaffold mineralization had also occurred by this period. Some human-derived vessels were still present at 5 months, but the majority of the graft vasculature had been functionally remodeled with host cells. In conclusion, clinically relevant progenitor sources for pericytes and endothelial cells can serve to generate highly functional microvascular networks for tissue engineered bone grafts.},

	Abstract = {Nanoimprinting promises low-cost fabrication of micro- and nano-devices by embossing features from a hard mould onto thermoplastic materials, typically polymers with low glass transition temperature. The success and proliferation of such methods critically rely on the manufacturing of robust and durable master moulds. Silicon-based moulds are brittle and have limited longevity. Metal moulds are stronger than semiconductors, but patterning of metals on the nanometre scale is limited by their finite grain size. Amorphous metals (metallic glasses) exhibit superior mechanical properties and are intrinsically free from grain size limitations. Here we demonstrate direct nanopatterning of metallic glasses by hot embossing, generating feature sizes as small as 13 nm. After subsequently crystallizing the as-formed metallic glass mould, we show that another amorphous sample of the same alloy can be formed on the crystallized mould. In addition, metallic glass replicas can also be used as moulds for polymers or other metallic glasses with lower softening temperatures. Using this 'spawning' process, we can massively replicate patterned surfaces through direct moulding without using conventional lithography. We anticipate that our findings will catalyse the development of micro- and nanoscale metallic glass applications that capitalize on the outstanding mechanical properties, microstructural homogeneity and isotropy, and ease of thermoplastic forming exhibited by these materials.},

@article{Burger2006,
	Abstract = {Signals from the microenvironment have a profound influence on the maintenance and/or progression of hematopoietic and epithelial cancers. Mesenchymal or marrow-derived stromal cells, which constitute a large proportion of the non-neoplastic cells within the tumor microenvironment, constitutively secrete the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). CXCL12 secretion by stromal cells attracts cancer cells, acting through its cognate receptor, CXCR4, which is expressed by both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumor cells. CXCR4 promotes tumor progression by direct and indirect mechanisms. First, CXCR4 is essential for metastatic spread to organs where CXCL12 is expressed, and thereby allows tumor cells to access cellular niches, such as the marrow, that favor tumor-cell survival and growth. Second, stromal-derived CXCL12 itself can stimulate survival and growth of neoplastic cells in a paracrine fashion. Third, CXCL12 can promote tumor angiogenesis by attracting endothelial cells to the tumor microenvironment. CXCR4 expression is a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, such as acute myelogenous leukemia or breast carcinoma. Promising results in preclinical tumor models indicate that CXCR4 antagonists may have antitumor activity in patients with various malignancies. Collectively, these observations reveal that CXCR4 is an important molecule involved in the spread and progression of a variety of different tumors. As such, CXCR4 antagonists, although initially developed for treatment of AIDS, actually may become effective agents for the treatment of neoplastic disease.},

	Abstract = {Angiogenesis is considered a hallmark of multiple myeloma (MM) progression. In the present study, we evaluated the morphological and functional features of endothelial cells (ECs) derived from bone marrow (BM) of patients affected by MM (MMECs). We found that MMECs compared with normal BM ECs (BMECs) showed increased expression of syndecan-1. Silencing of syndecan-1 expression by RNA interference technique decreased in vitro EC survival, proliferation and organization in capillary-like structures. In vivo, in severe combined immunodeficient mice, syndecan-1 silencing inhibited MMEC organization into patent vessels. When overexpressed in human umbilical vein ECs and BMECs, syndecan-1 induced in vitro and in vivo angiogenic effects. Flow-cytometric analysis of MMECs silenced for syndecan-1 expression indicated a decreased membrane expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis showed colocalization of VEGFR-2 with syndecan-1. Absence of nuclear translocation of VEGFR-2 in syndecan-1-knockdown cells together with the shift from perinuclear localization to recycling compartments suggest a role of syndecan-1 in modulation of VEGFR-2 localization. This correlated with an in vitro decreased VEGF-induced invasion and motility. These results suggest that syndecan-1 may contribute to the highly angiogenic phenotype of MMECs by promoting EC proliferation, survival and modulating VEGF-VEGFR-2 signalling.},

@article{Paino2014,
	Abstract = {Despite recent advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), it remains an incurable disease potentially due to the presence of resistant myeloma cancer stem cells (MM-CSC). Although the presence of clonogenic cells in MM was described three decades ago, the phenotype of MM-CSC is still controversial, especially with respect to the expression of syndecan-1 (CD138). Here, we demonstrate the presence of two subpopulations--CD138++ (95-99{\%}) and CD138low (1-5{\%})--in eight MM cell lines. To find out possible stem-cell-like features, we have phenotypically, genomic and functionally characterized the two subpopulations. Our results show that the minor CD138low subpopulation is morphologically identical to the CD138++ fraction and does not represent a more immature B-cell compartment (with lack of CD19, CD20 and CD27 expression). Moreover, both subpopulations have similar gene expression and genomic profiles. Importantly, both CD138++ and CD138low subpopulations have similar sensitivity to bortezomib, melphalan and doxorubicin. Finally, serial engraftment in CB17-SCID mice shows that CD138++ as well as CD138low cells have self-renewal potential and they are phenotypically interconvertible. Overall, our results differ from previously published data in MM cell lines which attribute a B-cell phenotype to MM-CSC. Future characterization of clonal plasma cell subpopulations in MM patients' samples will guarantee the discovery of more reliable markers able to discriminate true clonogenic myeloma cells.},

We first describe two methods of fabrication of polymer microfluidic chips, namely UV-laser photoablation and plasma etching that are well suited for the prototyping and mass fabrication of microchannel networks with integrated microelectrodes. These microanalytical systems can be coupled with various detection means including mass spectrometry, and their applications in capillary electrophoresis are presented here. We also present how UV laser photoablation can be used for the patterning of biomolecules on polymer surfaces for generating two-dimensional arrays of microspots to carry out affinity assays. Finally, the use of the microchips for the development of fast affinity and immunological assays with electrochemical detection is presented, demonstrating the potential of these polymer microchips for medical diagnostics and drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {The organization of cells into epithelium depends on cell interaction with both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and adjacent cells. The role of cell-cell adhesion in the regulation of epithelial topology is well-described. ECM is better known to promote cell migration and provide a structural scaffold for cell anchoring, but its contribution to multicellular morphogenesis is less well-understood. We developed a minimal model system to investigate how ECM affects the spatial organization of intercellular junctions. Fibronectin micropatterns were used to constrain the location of cell-ECM adhesion. We found that ECM affects the degree of stability of intercellular junction positioning and the magnitude of intra- and intercellular forces. Intercellular junctions were permanently displaced, and experienced large perpendicular tensional forces as long as they were positioned close to ECM. They remained stable solely in regions deprived of ECM, where they were submitted to lower tensional forces. The heterogeneity of the spatial organization of ECM induced anisotropic distribution of mechanical constraints in cells, which seemed to adapt their position to minimize both intra- and intercellular forces. These results uncover a morphogenetic role for ECM in the mechanical regulation of cells and intercellular junction positioning.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we focus on the enormous potential of a CO(2)-laser system for rapidly producing polymer microfluidic structures. The dependence was assessed of the depth and width of laser-cut channels on the laser beam power and on the number of passes of the beam along the same channel. In the experiments the laser beam power was varied between 0 and 40 W and the passes were varied in the range of 1 to 7 times. Typical channel depths were between 100 and 300 microm, while the channels were typically 250 microm wide. The narrowest produced channel was 85 microm wide. Several bonding methods for microstructured PMMA [poly(methyl methacrylate)] parts were investigated, such as solvent-assisted glueing, melting, laminating and surface activation using a plasma asher. A solvent-assisted thermal bonding method proved to be the most time-efficient one. Using laser micromachining together with bonding, a three-layer polymer microstructure with included optical fibers was fabricated within two days. The use of CO(2)-laser systems to produce microfluidic systems has not been published before. These systems provide a cost effective alternative to UV-laser systems and they are especially useful in microfluidic prototyping due to the very short cycle time of production.},

@article{Wang2013,
	Abstract = {The liquid drop captured at the capillary end, which is observed in capillary valve and pendant drop technique, is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Because of contact line pinning of the lower meniscus, the lower contact angle is able to rise from the intrinsic contact angle ($\theta$*) so that the external force acting on the drop can be balanced by the capillary force. In the absence of contact angle hysteresis (CAH), the upper contact angle remains at $\theta$*. However, in the presence of CAH, the upper contact angle can descend to provide more capillary force. The coupling between the lower and upper contact angles determines the equilibrium shape of the captured drop. In a capillary valve, the pinned contact line can move across the edge as the pressure difference exceeds the valving pressure, which depends on the geometrical characteristic and wetting property of the valve opening. When CAH is considered, the valving pressure is elevated because the capillary force is enhanced by the receding contact angle. For a pendant drop under gravity, the maximal capillary force is achieved as the lower contact angle reaches 180$\,^{\circ}$ in the absence of CAH. However, in the presence of CAH, four regimes can be identified by three critical drop volumes. The lower contact angle can exceed 180$\,^{\circ}$, and therefore the drop takes on the shape of a light bulb, which does not exist in the absence of CAH. The comparisons between Surface Evolver simulations and experiments are quite well.},

	Abstract = {Methods of shaping and manipulating liquids on small scales are important for micro-patterning, microfluidics and biosensing, and may provide fundamental insights into phenomena in confined small spaces. Here, we report a simple technique for shaping liquids into micrometre-scale filaments. Microgrooves on microwrinkles generated by thin film buckling on elastic substrates can function as open channel capillaries for liquids with appropriate wettabilities. Tuning the groove depth of the microwrinkles by modulating strain, we explore the capillary action of various liquids in microgrooves, which form liquid filaments emanating from a large reservoir. This behaviour is explained in terms of sinusoidal-geometry-dependent surface energy. Based on this concept, a regular array of liquid filaments can be formed over a large area by a simple coating method, and these filaments can be further reshaped by exploiting strain-induced nonlinear changes in microwrinkle topography. This technology shows promise for applications in micro-patterning, nano- and micro-reactors, and microfluidics.},

Here we present an approach to reduced cost molecular diagnostic instrumentation that has the potential to empower developing world communities by reducing costs through streamlining the sample preparation process. In addition, this instrument is capable of producing its own consumable devices on demand, reducing reliance on assay suppliers. Furthermore, this instrument is designed with an ``open'' architecture, allowing users to visually observe the assay process and make modifications as necessary (as opposed to traditional ``black box'' systems). This open environment enables integration of microfluidic fabrication and viral RNA purification onto an easy-to-use modular system via the use of interchangeable trays. Here we employ this system to develop a protocol to fabricate microfluidic devices and then use these devices to isolate viral RNA from serum for the measurement of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load. Results obtained from this method show significantly reduced error compared with similar nonautomated sample preparation processes. },

Multivariate statistical modeling of the spectra shows that the genetic predisposition of the 129S6 mouse to impaired glucose homeostasis and NAFLD is associated with disruptions of choline metabolism, i.e., low circulating levels of plasma phosphatidylcholine and high urinary excretion of methylamines (dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide), coprocessed by symbiotic gut microbiota and mammalian enzyme systems. Conversion of choline into methylamines by microbiota in strain 129S6 on a high-fat diet reduces the bioavailability of choline and mimics the effect of choline-deficient diets, causing NAFLD. These data also indicate that gut microbiota may play an active role in the development of insulin resistance.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional tissue engineering of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex process aiming to aid the regeneration of structural layers of smooth muscle, intrinsic enteric neuronal plexuses, specialized mucosa, and epithelial cells as well as interstitial cells. The final tissue-engineered construct is intended to mimic the native GI tract anatomically and physiologically. Physiological functionality of tissue-engineered constructs is of utmost importance while considering clinical translation. The construct comprises of cellular components as well as biomaterial scaffolding components. Together, these determine the immune response a tissue-engineered construct would elicit from a host upon implantation. Over the last decade, significant advances have been made to mitigate adverse host reactions. These include a quest for identifying autologous cell sources like embryonic and adult stem cells, bone marrow-derived cells, neural crest-derived cells, and muscle derived-stem cells. Scaffolding biomaterials have been fabricated with increasing biocompatibility and biodegradability. Manufacturing processes have advanced to allow for precise spatial architecture of scaffolds to mimic in vivo milieu closely and achieve neovascularization. This review will focus on the current concepts and the future vision of functional tissue engineering of the diverse neuromuscular structures of the GI tract from the esophagus to the internal anal sphincter.},

	Abstract = {Over the past few years, establishment and adaptation of cell-based assays for drug development and testing has become an important topic in high-throughput screening (HTS). Most new assays are designed to rapidly detect specific cellular effects reflecting action at various targets. However, although more complex than cell-free biochemical test systems, HTS assays using monolayer or suspension cultures still reflect a highly artificial cellular environment and may thus have limited predictive value for the clinical efficacy of a compound. Today's strategies for drug discovery and development, be they hypothesis free or mechanism based, require facile, HTS-amenable test systems that mimic the human tissue environment with increasing accuracy in order to optimize preclinical and preanimal selection of the most active molecules from a large pool of potential effectors, for example, against solid tumors. Indeed, it is recognized that 3-dimensional cell culture systems better reflect the in vivo behavior of most cell types. However, these 3-D test systems have not yet been incorporated into mainstream drug development operations. This article addresses the relevance and potential of 3-D in vitro systems for drug development, with a focus on screening for novel antitumor drugs. Examples of 3-D cell models used in cancer research are given, and the advantages and limitations of these systems of intermediate complexity are discussed in comparison with both 2-D culture and in vivo models. The most commonly used 3-D cell culture systems, multicellular spheroids, are emphasized due to their advantages and potential for rapid development as HTS systems. Thus, multicellular tumor spheroids are an ideal basis for the next step in creating HTS assays, which are predictive of in vivo antitumor efficacy.},

	Abstract = {A crucial factor in tissue engineering of heart valves is the functional and physiologic scaffold design. In our current experiment, we describe a new fabrication technique for heart valve scaffolds, derived from x-ray computed tomography data linked to the rapid prototyping technique of stereolithography. To recreate the complex anatomic structure of a human pulmonary and aortic homograft, we have used stereolithographic models derived from x-ray computed tomography and specific software (CP, Aachen, Germany). These stereolithographic models were used to generate biocompatible and biodegradable heart valve scaffolds by a thermal processing technique. The scaffold forming polymer was a thermoplastic elastomer, a poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) and a polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHOH) (Tepha, Inc., Cambridge, MA). We fabricated one human aortic root scaffold and one pulmonary heart valve scaffold. Analysis of the heart valve included functional testing in a pulsatile bioreactor under subphysiological and supraphysiological flow and pressure conditions. Using stereolithography, we were able to fabricate plastic models with accurate anatomy of a human valvular homograft. Moreover, we fabricated heart valve scaffolds with a physiologic valve design, which included the sinus of Valsalva, and that resembled our reconstructed aortic root and pulmonary valve. One advantage of P4HB and PHOH was the ability to mold a complete trileaflet heart valve scaffold from a stereolithographic model without the need for suturing. The heart valves were tested in a pulsatile bioreactor, and it was noted that the leaflets opened and closed synchronously under subphysiological and supraphysiological flow conditions. Our preliminary results suggest that the reproduction of complex anatomic structures by rapid prototyping techniques may be useful to fabricate custom made polymeric scaffolds for the tissue engineering of heart valves.},

	Abstract = {Although the field of microfluidics has made significant progress in bringing new tools to address biological questions, the accessibility and adoption of microfluidics within the life sciences are still limited. Open microfluidic systems have the potential to lower the barriers to adoption, but the absence of robust design rules has hindered their use. Here, we present an open microfluidic platform, suspended microfluidics, that uses surface tension to fill and maintain a fluid in microscale structures devoid of a ceiling and floor. We developed a simple and ubiquitous model predicting fluid flow in suspended microfluidic systems and show that it encompasses many known capillary phenomena. Suspended microfluidics was used to create arrays of collagen membranes, mico Dots ($\mu$Dots), in a horizontal plane separating two fluidic chambers, demonstrating a transwell platform able to discern collective or individual cellular invasion. Further, we demonstrated that $\mu$Dots can also be used as a simple multiplexed 3D cellular growth platform. Using the $\mu$Dot array, we probed the combined effects of soluble factors and matrix components, finding that laminin mitigates the growth suppression properties of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. Based on the same fluidic principles, we created a suspended microfluidic metabolite extraction platform using a multilayer biphasic system that leverages the accessibility of open microchannels to retrieve steroids and other metabolites readily from cell culture. Suspended microfluidics brings the high degree of fluidic control and unique functionality of closed microfluidics into the highly accessible and robust platform of open microfluidics.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) culture models are emerging as invaluable tools in tumor biology, since they reproduce tissue-specific structural features and cell-cell interactions more accurately than conventional 2-D cultures. Multiple Myeloma, which depends on myeloma cell-Bone Marrow microenvironment interactions for development and response to drugs, may particularly benefit from such an approach. An innovative 3-D dynamic culture model based on the use of the RCCS{\texttrademark} Bioreactor was developed to allow long-term culture of myeloma tissue explants. This model was first validated with normal and pathological explants, then applied to tissues from myeloma patients. In all cases, histological examination demonstrated maintenance of viable myeloma cells inside their native microenvironment, with an overall well preserved histo-architecture including bone lamellae and vessels. This system was then successfully applied to evaluate the cytotoxic effects exerted by the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib not only on myeloma cells but also on angiogenic vessels. Moreover, as surrogate markers of specialized functions expressed by myeloma cells and microenvironment, $\beta$2 microglobulin, VEGF and Angiopoietin-2 levels, as well as Matrix Metalloproteases activity, were evaluated in supernatants from 3D cultures and their levels reflected the effects of Bortezomib treatment. Notably, determination of $\beta$2 microglobulin levels in supernatants from Bortezomib-treated samples and in patients'sera following Bortezomib-based therapies disclosed an overall concordance in the response to the drug ex vivo and in vivo. Our findings indicate, as a proof of principle, that 3-D, RCCS{\texttrademark} bioreactor-based culture of tissue explants can be exploited for studying myeloma biology and for a pre-clinical approach to patient-targeted therapy.},

	Abstract = {Our previous studies showed that anti-$\beta$2M monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have strong and direct apoptotic effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, suggesting that anti-$\beta$2M mAbs might be developed as a novel therapeutic agent. In this study, we investigated the anti-MM effects of combination treatment with anti-$\beta$2M mAbs and bortezomib (BTZ). Our results showed that anti-$\beta$2M mAbs enhanced BTZ-induced apoptosis of MM cell lines and primary MM cells. Combination treatment could also induce apoptosis of BTZ-resistant MM cells, and the enhanced effect depended on the surface expression of $\beta$2M on MM cells. BTZ up-regulated the expression of autophagy proteins, whereas combination with anti-$\beta$2M mAbs inhibited autophagy. Sequence analysis of the promoter region of beclin 1 identified 3 putative NF-$\kappa$B-binding sites from -615 to -789 bp. BTZ treatment increased, whereas combination with anti-$\beta$2M mAbs reduced, NF-$\kappa$B transcription activities in MM cells, and combination treatment inhibited NF-$\kappa$B p65 binding to the beclin 1 promoter. Furthermore, anti-$\beta$2M mAbs and BTZ combination treatment had anti-MM activities in an established MM mouse model. Thus, our studies provide new insight and support for the clinical development of an anti-$\beta$2M mAb and BTZ combination treatment to overcome BTZ drug resistance and improve MM patient survival.},

Recent studies analyzing the mechanistic basis for phenotypic heterogeneity observed among different oncogenes (e.g., ErbB2, cyclin D1) have illustrated the utility of this three-dimensional culture system in modeling the biological activities of cancer genes, particularly with regard to their ability to disrupt epithelial architecture during the early aspects of carcinoma formation.

@article{Roodman2001a,
	Abstract = {Bone is a frequent site of cancer metastasis. Bone metastases can result in bone destruction or new bone formation. Bone destruction is mediated by factors produced or induced by tumor cells that stimulate formation and activation of osteoclasts, the normal bone-resorbing cells. Local bone destruction also occurs in patients with osteoblastic metastases and may precede or occur simultaneously with increased bone formation. Several factors, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) ligand, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha (MIP-1alpha), have been implicated as factors that enhance osteoclast formation and bone destruction in patients with neoplasia. PTHrP seems to be the major factor produced by breast cancer cells that induces osteoclast formation through upregulation of RANK ligand. Enhanced RANK ligand expression also plays an important role in bone destruction in patients with myeloma. RANK ligand can act to enhance the effects of other factors produced by myeloma cells or in response to myeloma cells, such as MIP-1alpha and/or IL-6, to induce osteoclast formation. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for osteoclast activation in osteolytic metastases should lead to development of novel therapeutic approaches for this highly morbid and potentially fatal complication of cancer.},

@article{Au2014b,
	Abstract = {The vast majority of microfluidic devices are developed in PDMS by molding ("soft lithography") because PDMS is an inexpensive material, has physicochemical properties that are well suited for biomedical and physical sciences applications, and design cycle lengths are generally adequate for prototype development. However, PDMS molding is tediously slow and thus cannot provide the high- or medium-volume production required for the commercialization of devices. While high-throughput plastic molding techniques (e.g. injection molding) exist, the exorbitant cost of the molds and/or the equipment can be a serious obstacle for device commercialization, especially for small startups. High-volume production is not required to reach niche markets such as clinical trials, biomedical research supplies, customized research equipment, and classroom projects. Crucially, both PDMS and plastic molding are layer-by-layer techniques where each layer is produced as a result of physicochemical processes not specified in the initial photomask(s) and where the final device requires assembly by bonding, all resulting in a cost that is very hard to predict at the start of the project. By contrast, stereolithography (SL) is an automated fabrication technique that allows for the production of quasi-arbitrary 3D shapes in a single polymeric material at medium-volume throughputs (ranging from a single part to hundreds of parts). Importantly, SL devices can be designed between several groups using CAD tools, conveniently ordered by mail, and their cost precisely predicted via a web interface. Here we evaluate the resolution of an SL mail-order service and the main causes of resolution loss; the optical clarity of the devices and how to address the lack of clarity for imaging in the channels; and the future role that SL could play in the commercialization of microfluidic devices.},

	Abstract = {Cell adhesion is a broad topic in cell biology that involves physical interactions between cells and other cells or the surrounding extracellular matrix, and is implicated in major research areas including cancer, development, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. While current methods have contributed significantly to our understanding of cell adhesion, these methods are unsuitable for tackling many biological questions requiring intermediate numbers of cells (10(2)-10(5)), including small animal biopsies, clinical samples, and rare cell isolates. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we developed a new assay to quantify the adhesion of {\~{}}10(2)-10(3) cells at a time on engineered substrates, and examined the adhesion strength and population heterogeneity via distribution-based modeling. We validated the platform by testing adhesion strength of cancer cells from three different cancer types (breast, prostate, and multiple myeloma) on both IL-1$\beta$ activated and non-activated endothelial monolayers, and observed significantly increased adhesion for each cancer cell type upon endothelial activation, while identifying and quantifying distinct subpopulations of cell-substrate interactions. We then applied the assay to characterize adhesion of primary bone marrow stromal cells to different cardiac fibroblast-derived matrix substrates to demonstrate the ability to study limited cell populations in the context of cardiac cell-based therapies. Overall, these results demonstrate the sensitivity and robustness of the assay as well as its ability to enable extraction of high content, functional data from limited and potentially rare primary samples. We anticipate this method will enable a new class of biological studies with potential impact in basic and translational research.},

	Abstract = {SignificanceMicrofluidic systems promise to improve the analysis and synthesis of materials, biological or otherwise, by lowering the required volume of fluid samples, offering a tightly controlled fluid-handling environment, and simultaneously integrating various chemical processes. To build these systems, designers depend on microfabrication techniques that restrict them to arranging their designs in two dimensions and completely fabricating their design in a single step. This study introduces modular, reconfigurable components containing fluidic and sensor elements adaptable to many different microfluidic circuits. These elements can be assembled to allow for 3D routing of channels. This assembly approach allows for the application of network analysis techniques like those used in classical electronic circuit design, facilitating the straightforward design of predictable flow systems. Microfluidic systems are rapidly becoming commonplace tools for high-precision materials synthesis, biochemical sample preparation, and biophysical analysis. Typically, microfluidic systems are constructed in monolithic form by means of microfabrication and, increasingly, by additive techniques. These methods restrict the design and assembly of truly complex systems by placing unnecessary emphasis on complete functional integration of operational elements in a planar environment. Here, we present a solution based on discrete elements that liberates designers to build large-scale microfluidic systems in three dimensions that are modular, diverse, and predictable by simple network analysis techniques. We develop a sample library of standardized components and connectors manufactured using stereolithography. We predict and validate the flow characteristics of these individual components to design and construct a tunable concentration gradient generator with a scalable number of parallel outputs. We show that these systems are rapidly reconfigurable by constructing three variations of a device for generating monodisperse microdroplets in two distinct size regimes and in a high-throughput mode by simple replacement of emulsifier subcircuits. Finally, we demonstrate the capability for active process monitoring by constructing an optical sensing element for detecting water droplets in a fluorocarbon stream and quantifying their size and frequency. By moving away from large-scale integration toward standardized discrete elements, we demonstrate the potential to reduce the practice of designing and assembling complex 3D microfluidic circuits to a methodology comparable to that found in the electronics industry.},

	Abstract = {Planar nanochannels are of particular significance in nanofluidics: keeping the width on the micrometre scale prevents the use of nanolithography while the depth stays in the nanometric range, i.e. below 100 nm. Fabrication of wide and shallow nanochannels in a plastic is known to be challenging due to the collapse of the structure during the sealing step. In this Technical Note, we demonstrate the simple and low-cost fabrication without nanolithography of monolithic and planar nanochannels by hot-embossing and bonding below the glass transition temperature.},

	Abstract = {Stereolithography is a solid freeform technique (SFF) that was introduced in the late 1980s. Although many other techniques have been developed since then, stereolithography remains one of the most powerful and versatile of all SFF techniques. It has the highest fabrication accuracy and an increasing number of materials that can be processed is becoming available. In this paper we discuss the characteristic features of the stereolithography technique and compare it to other SFF techniques. The biomedical applications of stereolithography are reviewed, as well as the biodegradable resin materials that have been developed for use with stereolithography. Finally, an overview of the application of stereolithography in preparing porous structures for tissue engineering is given.},

@article{Beards2010,
	Abstract = {Sweeteners are being sourced to lower the energetic value of confectionery including chocolates. Some, especially non-digestible carbohydrates, may possess other benefits for human health upon their fermentation by the colonic microbiota. The present study assessed non-digestible carbohydrate sweeteners, selected for use in low-energy chocolates, for their ability to beneficially modulate faecal bacterial profiles in human volunteers. Forty volunteers consumed a test chocolate (low-energy or experimental chocolate) containing 22.8 g of maltitol (MTL), MTL and polydextrose (PDX), or MTL and resistant starch for fourteen consecutive days. The dose of the test chocolates was doubled every 2 weeks over a 6-week period. Numbers of faecal bifidobacteria significantly increased with all the three test treatments. Chocolate containing the PDX blend also significantly increased faecal lactobacilli (P = 0.00 001) after the 6 weeks. The PDX blend also showed significant increases in faecal propionate and butyrate (P = 0.002 and 0.006, respectively). All the test chocolates were well tolerated with no significant change in bowel habit or intestinal symptoms even at a daily dose of 45.6 g of non-digestible carbohydrate sweetener. This is of importance not only for giving manufacturers a sugar replacement that can reduce energetic content, but also for providing a well-tolerated means of delivering high levels of non-digestible carbohydrates into the colon, bringing about improvements in the biomarkers of gut health.},
