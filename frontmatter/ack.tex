I need to thank Dr. Dave Beebe for bringing me into such an amazing lab with such amazing people. He was able to culture an innovative, supportive, and collaborative environment giving me freedom to go out and pursue my ideas and the grounding to not get lost really allowing me to grow as a researcher and as an individual.

I appreciate my committee, Drs. Shigeki Miyamoto, Fotis Asimakopoulos, William Murphy, and Dave Schwartz for helping me focus my engineering aspirations into practical biology applications.

All of the mentors and friends I've had in the MMB lab since starting. Drs. Edmond Young, Ashleigh Therberge, Erwin Berthier, and Jay Warrick for giving me their time, their patience, and knowledge helping me with everything from PDMS fabrication to manuscript writing, to baking. John Guckenberger for spending hours with me on an SEM considerably older than either of us. Drs. Patrick Ingram and Brian Johnson for being there to work through engineering and biological problems with me. Jason Yu for continuing to push along stacks even when our cells didn't care enough to live. Kelsey Veserat, the world's greatest undergraduate researcher. Drs. Ben Casavant and Scott Berry for showing me how it's done. Tony Jimenez-Torres, Dr. Layla Barkal, Dr. Mary Reiger, for going through the struggle with me. Alice Puchalski for being the glue that holds the MMB lab together.

My family and friends. Mom, dad, and Corey for all of their love, support, and enthusiasm. Larissa and Dan, my only friends brave enough to visit Wisconsin.
