The microenvironment tissue microenvironment a complex and dynamic system. When microenvironments become dysregulated it can lead to a number of diseases including cancer. Understanding the interactions in the microenvironment is key to understanding disease progression and could lead to the development of new and effective therapies. The complexity of the microenvironment makes the development of \invitro\ models challenging. A model needs to have the appropriate context to make it a good biological proxy for the system it's designed to investigate, but also needs to simple enough so that researchers can manipulate it to get good data from the model. 

Microfluidic techniques and technologies are amenable for complex tissue engineering tools to achieve high biological relevance and allow for precise control and manipulation over many signals experienced in the model making them well-suited for developing \invitro\ models. In spite of their benefits, microfluidics has not yet achieved widespread adoption in the biology community. To achieve higher penetration of microfluidics-based \invitro\ models on the biology bench, engineers need to design systems with not only the biology in mind, but also the biologist. This document describes how choice of material, fabrication method, and how a user interfaces with a microfluidic platform can not only lead a more biology-friendly \invitro\ model, but can enable models that would be difficult of impossible to achieve without these design considerations.
